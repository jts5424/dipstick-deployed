This Immediate Maint. Due page is on the right track and matches the “immediate liability / deduct from asking price” intent. It’s basically the “Immediate Maintenance Due” tab Jason wanted in the tab order. 

Dipstick v2 round

But you have two things to fix to make it consistent + more persuasive (without bloating it).

What’s good

The top banner framing is correct: “these are past due / pay immediately / deduct from asking price.”

The cards have:

severity tag

cost range

negotiation angle

Use Leverage CTA
That ties directly into the talk-track engine, which is the whole point of leverage builder.

What’s wrong / missing (specific)
1) The banner math is clearly broken

It says “$35 in Deferred Maintenance” while each card shows $100–$200, $100–$150, $300–$600.

So either:

the banner is pulling the wrong field, or

it’s truncating/formatting wrong, or

it’s mixing “count” vs “$”.

Fix: Banner should show:

Immediate liability total (min–max): $500–$950 (sum of ranges), and

optionally: “3 items past due.”

This page lives or dies on that headline number.

2) You need one extra field per item: “due because…”

Right now “Negotiation angle” is good, but Jason’s leverage framing was “truth + credibility,” not just claims. 

Dipstick v2 round

Add one line under each card title:

Evidence trigger: “Last recorded at 62k miles” or “No record in 18 months” or “OEM interval: 40k miles; now 72k”
(Keep it short. This is what makes it feel real.)

3) Add a “selected leverage” state (so this page feeds the script)

If I click “Use Leverage,” I should see:

the card changes to “Added to Leverage Builder”

a small counter at top: “3 items added”

a link: “Go to Leverage Builder”

Otherwise it feels disconnected.

Replit copy/paste note
Immediate Maint Due page is correct conceptually, but:

1) Fix the header total: it must display the true immediate liability range (sum of item min/max) and item count. Current “$35” is wrong.
2) Add 1-line evidence trigger per item (last recorded date/mileage or missing record vs OEM interval) to support credibility.
3) When “Use Leverage” is clicked, show selected state + counter + deep link to Leverage Builder.


If you send the Leverage Builder page next, I’ll tell you whether it matches what he wanted (tones/risk tolerance + objection handlers + script preview) and whether anything else is missing.
