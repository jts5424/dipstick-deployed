Thought for 38s

Here’s the edit direction Jason gave for the Executive Summary / “Compare” page, in a form you can paste into Replit as the spec.

What this page is supposed to do

The page should show high-level abstractions from all the other tabs, as concisely as possible for the user.

He said the Executive Summary is “pretty right on.”

Required edits
1) Add a price input (so “fairly priced” isn’t guessing)

Add a user input / dialog box for the car’s price (listing price / your offer).

Place it above the Executive Summary or inside it.

Reason: the UI says “fairly priced” but there’s no place to enter price, which breaks the logic.

Implementation note for Replit:

Field: Purchase price ($) (number input)

That value should feed:

“Fairly priced / overpriced / underpriced”

“Cost of ownership” rollups (since those depend on what you pay)

2) Replace/adjust “Risk Evaluation” → make it a Cost Timeline

He wants the “risk evaluation” reframed because right now it’s basically just “repairs.”

Instead, make it a timeline / cumulative cost chart showing how ownership cost accrues over time/miles:

Start point: 0 miles from purchase or today’s date

Show step changes when immediate work is needed (example: oil change right when you buy it = a visible jump at mile 0). 

riverside_jason_raw-synced-vide…

Show future events at mileage markers (example: another oil change at 10,000 miles = another step).

The actual chart Jason described:

A cumulative line chart that increases over time/miles so users can see:

“If I buy today and own for X miles, I’ll accrue ~$Y cost”

Where cost is low vs where it skyrockets (his example: looks fine at 20–30k miles, but at 40k it spikes → tells you how long you should own it).

Implementation note for Replit:

Chart title: Cumulative Ownership Cost Over Time

X-axis toggle: Miles (default) / Time

Add a user control:

Ownership horizon (slider: miles, e.g., 0 → 60k)

Output: “Estimated cost by X miles: $Y”

Data model suggestion:

maintenanceEvents[] = { mile, item, cost, requiredNow (bool), probability(optional) }

Cumulative = running sum over sorted events (step function)

3) Make the chart understandable (mom-friendly) + still technical

Not explicitly in Jason’s clip, but it fits his “concise abstractions” goal and solves your readability issue:

Under the cost timeline chart, add two stacked explanations:

Everyday speak: “This line is the money you’ll likely spend on upkeep as you drive. Jumps = scheduled work hits.”

Technical: “Cumulative expected maintenance/repair cost. Step increases occur at predicted service intervals.”
