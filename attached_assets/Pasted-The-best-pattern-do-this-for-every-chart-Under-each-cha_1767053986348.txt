The best pattern (do this for every chart)

Under each chart, render a small “Explain” block with the same structure:

1) How to read (static, 1 sentence)

Always the same per chart type.

2) What it means (dynamic, 1–2 sentences)

Computed from the chart values.

3) Key takeaway (one bold line)

“Winner saves $X here.”

4) Why we’re confident (optional chip)

“Confidence: Medium (gaps detected)”

What to compute for each of your charts
A) Depreciation Curves

Dynamic values to compute:

Value at horizon for each car

Depreciation loss over horizon for each car

Delta between #1 and #2

What it means template:

“At {years} years, {winner} is projected to retain ${delta_value} more value than {runner_up}.”

“That’s about ${delta_per_year}/yr in reduced value loss.”

Also add markers on the chart (even in multi-car):

show the “ownership horizon” point.

B) TCO Breakdown (stacked bars)

Compute:

Total TCO for each car

Breakdown components: depreciation / maintenance / repairs

Biggest driver of the delta

What it means template:

“Over {years} years, {winner} costs ${delta_tco} less than {runner_up}.”

“The biggest difference is {component} (Δ ${delta_component}).”

C) Performance Scorecard (table)

This is not self-explanatory. Add a short explainer under it:

Compute:

Which category the winner wins

Any “watch-out category” where the winner loses

What it means template:

“{winner} leads on {top_category}. {runner_up} only wins on {category}.”

“If you care most about {losing_category}, consider {runner_up}.”

Where your current copy is failing

You have “retains roughly $0 more equity” — that’s a dead giveaway you aren’t pulling the real delta or you’re rounding wrong.

Fix: never allow “$0” outputs:

If abs(delta) < $250, say “roughly the same” instead of “$0”.
Example:

“These curves are essentially tied over 3 years (within ~$250).”

Replit copy/paste spec
Add an “Explain this chart” block under EVERY chart using a consistent template:

For each chart:
- How to read (static 1 sentence)
- What it means (dynamic 1–2 sentences computed from values)
- Key takeaway (bold, numeric delta)
- Optional confidence chip

Depreciation chart: compute value-at-horizon + delta vs #2; avoid $0 by using “roughly the same” if delta < $250.
TCO chart: compute total delta + biggest driver component.
Scorecard: state which categories winner leads/loses and when to choose runner-up.


If you paste your current data objects for these charts (what fields you have in code), I’ll write the exact formula snippets + the final copy templates using your variable names.
