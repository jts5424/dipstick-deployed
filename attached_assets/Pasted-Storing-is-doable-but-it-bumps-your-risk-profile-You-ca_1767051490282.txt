Storing is doable, but it bumps your risk profile. You can still make it sane if you treat the PDF like a private user upload and you never redistribute or repackage it.

Here’s the clean “low-risk” way to store.

Safer storage approach (do this)
1) Store the PDF as a private attachment, not as a “report”

Store per-user, per-vehicle.

No public URLs. No share links. No indexing. No CDN URL that anyone can guess.

Access only after auth; short-lived signed URLs if needed.

2) Don’t output the PDF back to the user from your app

No “Download original report” button.

No “Share report” that includes the uploaded CARFAX PDF.

If you want to be extra safe: don’t store it long-term at all — store extracted structured data, delete the PDF after parsing, and show “we don’t store your original report.”

3) Parse → store structured data → keep PDFs siloed

Extract events, dates, mileage, gaps, service items, VIN, recall campaign IDs.

Run analysis on the structured data.

Your exported “Generate PDF report” should be Dipstick analysis, not the uploaded report contents.

4) UI copy changes (must do)

Change “Upload CARFAX” to “Upload vehicle history report (PDF)”

Add a clear disclaimer in the wizard:

“Upload a report you own/have rights to use (e.g., a CARFAX PDF you purchased).”

“Dipstick is not affiliated with CARFAX.”

5) Never show CARFAX branding or imply integration

No CARFAX logos, no “CARFAX verified,” no “Connect CARFAX.”

6) Security + compliance basics (non-negotiable)

Encrypt at rest

Virus scan uploads

Retention policy (e.g., auto-delete after 30/60/90 days unless user keeps it)

“Delete vehicle” deletes the PDF

Button label: Add Vehicle

Modal option: Upload vehicle history report (PDF)

Subtext: “CARFAX/AutoCheck supported”

Copy/paste spec for Replit
We store uploaded PDFs. Implement these safeguards:

- Rename UI from “Upload CARFAX” to “Upload vehicle history report (PDF)”.
- Add disclaimer: “Upload reports you own/have rights to use. Dipstick is not affiliated with CARFAX.”
- Store PDFs privately per-user/per-vehicle (no public links, no share/download).
- Parse and store structured extracted data; analysis + exports must be Dipstick-generated, not reproduction of the source PDF.
- Add retention + delete controls: deleting a vehicle deletes the PDF.
- Security: auth-gated access, signed URLs, encryption at rest, malware scan.


If you want the lowest-risk version: delete the PDF after parsing and store only extracted data. If you insist on storing it, the rules above are the minimum.
