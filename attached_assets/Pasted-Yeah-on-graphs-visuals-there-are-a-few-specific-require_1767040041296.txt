Yeah — on **graphs/visuals**, there are a few **specific requirements** in the transcript that are easy to miss. Here’s the **complete visuals spec** (what goes where + how it should behave), pulled directly from the lines where you guys talked about it.

## A) “Dipstick It” (Comparator) should be **mostly graphs + narrative**

**Rule:** “The only thing… in comparator is just visualizations that back that up.” 

### Required visuals (Comparator)

1. **Stacked depreciation curves (both cars on ONE chart)**

* “Both curves stacked… showing *you are here* and *you are here*.” 
* It should respond to inputs: miles + years → show projected position for each car. 

2. **Total Cost of Ownership graph BELOW the depreciation chart**

* Explicit callout: “Total cost of ownership. Graph below too.” 

3. **Cost breakdown bars (the engineering-style stacked bars)**

* “Just depreciation chart… exactly how you did this cost breakdown. I love that with the bars.” 
  (So: keep the bars as a core visual element in Comparator.)

### Required “explain the graphs” layer (Comparator)

4. **Narrative explanation + tooltips**

* “Comparator should be a… high level narrative and then just the graphs… explain the charts like in a tooltip…” 
* Reason: “Some people aren’t good at graphs… explain how to interpret the graph.” 
* Also: It **can’t be advice**; it has to be framed as **interpretation**. 

### What NOT to do (Comparator)

5. **No big cards / no “second Garage”**

* “I don’t think we should have cards in the comparator… you already have the cards in garage.” 
* If any car visual exists: keep **small thumbnails**, not scroll-bloat.

## B) Single-car Analysis visuals you should KEEP (these were praised)

These aren’t “Comparator” charts — they’re the **deep analysis visuals** you already have.

1. **Risk Urgency Map**

* “Whoa… that’s really cool. Risk urgency map.” 

2. **Perfect failure probability / unscheduled maintenance survivability curve**

* “Perfect failure probability unscheduled maintenance survivability curve. Yo, that’s sick.” 

So if you’re telling Replit what to preserve: **don’t delete these** — they’re part of the “wow.”

## C) Service History visuals: color legend + filtering must be obvious

* You called out the **color coding** (green/blue/yellow) and asked for it to be made clear. 
* Legend definition: “Green is maintenance, blue is inspection, yellow is repair.” 
* Filtering/toggle should work consistently (it was “not functioning” in one instance).

### If you want the tight “Replit instruction”

Tell Replit:

* **Comparator page =** Narrative block + (1) stacked depreciation curves with “you are here” markers + (2) TCO graph below + (3) cost breakdown bars + tooltips explaining how to read them; **no big cards**.  
* **Analysis page keeps** Risk Urgency Map + failure probability/survivability curve visuals. 
* **Service history** must show an on-screen legend + working filters. 

If you want, paste your current chart component names (e.g., `DepreciationChart.tsx`, `TCOChart.tsx`, `CostBreakdownBars.tsx`) and I’ll translate this into **exact component-level edits + acceptance criteria**.
