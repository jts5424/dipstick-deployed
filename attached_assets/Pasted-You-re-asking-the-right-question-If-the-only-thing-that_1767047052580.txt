You’re asking the right question. If the only thing that changes when you move tone/risk tolerance is price, the product stays mid. The leverage builder has to change behavioral variables: what you say, what you ask, what you reveal, what you hold back, and how you close.

Here are the variables that should change when you scale it (even if price stays the same).

1) Tone (Friendly / Firm / Hard) should change THESE variables
A) Opener style

Friendly: rapport + appreciation

Firm: professional + direct

Hard: boundary + urgency

B) “Asks” type

Friendly: calibrated questions (“How can we make this fair?”)

Firm: anchored statement + calibrated question (“I’m at X. How do we make that work?”)

Hard: either/or close (“X price or fix Y — which?”)

C) Evidence depth

Friendly: fewer points, softer wording

Firm: top 3 points, factual

Hard: only dealbreakers, no fluff

D) Close structure

Friendly: collaborative next step

Firm: timebox-lite

Hard: explicit timebox + walkaway

E) Objection handlers

Same objection, different reply style (empathetic vs firm vs boundary).

2) Risk Tolerance (Low / Medium / High) should change THESE variables

This should NOT just move the offer number. It should change which leverage points get surfaced and how the script frames risk.

A) Leverage point selection

Low risk tolerance: overweight recalls, reliability, service gaps, high-probability failures

High risk tolerance: overweight valuation delta, depreciation, immediate maintenance only

B) Framing language

Low: “I’m not comfortable proceeding without X verified.”

High: “I’m fine with some work—price just needs to reflect it.”

C) Evidence threshold

Low: require confidence/evidence for claims; ask for receipts

High: less verification, more “price reflects condition”

D) Deal structure preference

Low: prefer repairs completed / verification over price cuts

High: prefer discount and DIY repairs

3) Seller Type (Dealer vs Private) must change THESE variables

Right now your script reads like a private-party negotiation. Dealers require different tactics.

Dealer

Ask for out-the-door price

Objections include: “priced to market,” “fees,” “we can’t negotiate”

Close is appointment-based: “If you can do X OTD, I’ll come at 6pm.”

Private seller

Ask for records, title status, why selling

Close is trust-based: “If you can do X, I can meet today with cash.”

4) Channel (Text vs Email vs Talk Track) should change structure

Not just formatting — the strategy changes.

Text: 2–4 lines max, one question, one close

Email: evidence + bullets + clear offer

Talk track: short phrases + pauses + “shut up” prompts

5) Negotiation stage (Verify → Offer → Objection → Close)

This is the biggest scaling lever. The builder should generate different scripts by stage:

Receipt Request (verify first)

Reality Check Questions

Offer

Objection Replies

Close & Logistics

Same leverage points, different script.

What should your “scale” actually do?

When the user changes Tone/Risk/Seller type, update these outputs:

Output 1: Selected points (auto)

reorder + add/remove based on risk tolerance

Output 2: Script skeleton

Friendly uses labels + calibrated questions

Firm uses accusation audit + anchor + calibrated question

Hard uses boundary + either/or + timebox

Output 3: Question set

1 killer question per leverage point (changes by tone)

Output 4: Objection pack

Different replies for “priced to market / sold as-is / already discounted”

Dealer vs private versions

Output 5: Close

timebox + logistics changes

Replit-ready checklist (copy/paste)
When scaling Leverage Builder, Tone/Risk Tolerance must change more than price.

Implement behavioral variable changes:
- tone controls: opener style, ask type (calibrated vs anchored vs either/or), evidence depth, close structure, objection reply style
- risk tolerance controls: leverage point selection weighting, framing language, evidence threshold, prefer repair-vs-discount deal structure
- seller type controls: dealer vs private templates + objections + close logistics
- channel controls: text/email/talk track structure differences
- stage controls: generate scripts for verify→offer→objection→close (not one monolithic script)
