❌ What you’re missing (and why it feels like “the curves are gone”)

Jason’s key ask was the Comparator/Dipstick It page being the core product with:

Executive Summary + Dipstick Score + train-of-thinking

Stacked depreciation curves for BOTH cars on one chart with “you are here” markers

TCO chart below

Cost breakdown bars

Graph explainers/tooltips
That’s explicitly the comparator spec in the transcript.

Your screenshots don’t show Dipstick It at all — so right now it looks like “we lost the curves,” but what’s actually happening is:

You have the single-car curve (Market Valuation).

You likely don’t yet have the multi-car stacked curves that must live in Dipstick It.

The “underwhelming comparator” diagnosis (why it’s failing)

If Dipstick It currently exists but feels weak, it’s because it’s missing this exact structure:

Dipstick It page order (required):

Inputs strip (ownership period + annual mileage + market price per car) + Compare CTA

Executive Summary (winner/lean + dipstick scores + key deltas)

Train-of-thinking narrative (interpretation, not advice)

Charts:

Also: Dipstick It is not supposed to dump all single-car analysis data. Keep it high level.

One more thing I see from your screenshots

On Projected Future Repairs, you have an “Unscheduled Maintenance” section with a toggle for “Survivability Curve” — but your screenshot only shows the Top Risks list, not the curve. Jason explicitly praised that survivability curve as a “wow” element in the single-car analysis, so make sure the curve actually renders when toggled.

What to tell Replit right now (copy/paste)
Based on current UI, single-car Analysis pages look mostly aligned (depreciation curve exists in Market Valuation, cost breakdown + risk urgency map exists, recall validation CTA exists).

BUT Dipstick It (Comparator) is either missing or underbuilt. Implement Dipstick It as the core product per transcript:
- Inputs (ownership period, annual mileage, market price per car) + Compare button
- Executive Summary + Dipstick score(s) + key deltas
- Train-of-thinking narrative (interpretation, not advice)
- Charts: stacked depreciation curves for BOTH cars w/ “you are here” markers; TCO chart below; cost breakdown bars
- Tooltips/how-to-read on charts
- Keep Dipstick It minimal (not a second Garage, not full single-car dump)

Also verify the “Survivability Curve” toggle in Projected Future Repairs actually renders the curve (not just Top Risks list).
