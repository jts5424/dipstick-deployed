Yep. Since I don’t have your exact current strings pasted, here’s a drop-in copy pack that gives you Simple + Technical for every major chart/module, using placeholders your code can fill. This will instantly make the app readable for “mom mode” while still satisfying power users.

Use it as a JSON/TS constant and render based on the user’s toggle.

How to use this in the UI

Default to Simple.

Add a small toggle: Explain: Simple | Technical.

Fill the placeholders from your computed deltas (winner vs runner-up, horizon years, etc.).

Guardrails:

If abs(delta) < $250, use the “tie” versions.

Never display “$0 more” — display “basically tied.”

If you paste your current existing explanation strings (even 5–10 lines) I’ll map them into this structure exactly, so you don’t have to retrofit it manually.
