Yes — if you keep this “two tiles + sliders” pattern and you ever have 10 vehicles, it’ll get clunky fast. You need a selection model that scales without turning Dipstick It into a spreadsheet.

Here’s the clean way to handle it.

The scaling problem

With 10 vehicles, users will need to:

pick 2 to compare (most common)

sometimes compare 3–4 (optional)

switch pairs quickly (“S7 vs A6”, then “S7 vs X”, etc.)
If they have to “deselect” through a messy UI, it’ll feel complicated.

Best solution: 2-slot compare picker

Treat comparison as two fixed slots:

Top bar becomes:

Compare Slots

Slot A: [Choose vehicle] (dropdown/search)

Slot B: [Choose vehicle] (dropdown/search)

Swap button ↔

Compare CTA

This scales perfectly to 10+ cars because you’re not managing a bunch of toggles.

Then add “quick chips” under it

A horizontal strip:

Recent comparisons: S7 vs A6, S7 vs 330i, A6 vs Q5
Clicking a chip fills the two slots.

Optional upgrade: allow “pin winner”

Crown icon means “winner pinned to Slot A”

Then user can click different cars to load into Slot B to “challenge the champ”

This feels game-like and makes the page fun.

What happens when it loads (default behavior)

When user opens Dipstick It:

If they have a recent comparison, load the last pair.

Else auto-load best guess pair:

the two most recently added cars, or

the two with the closest price, or

the two with “analysis ready” status

No one wants a blank compare screen.

If you want multi-car compare (later), don’t do it by default

If you ever add 3+ compare:

make it an “Advanced” toggle:

“Compare 2 (default) / Compare 3–4 (advanced)”

but keep the UI anchored on 2.

Replit copy/paste spec
Dipstick It must scale to 10+ vehicles.

Replace “select/deselect tiles” with a 2-slot compare picker:
- Slot A dropdown/search (Choose vehicle)
- Slot B dropdown/search
- Swap button
- Compare CTA

Add “Recent comparisons” chips for fast switching.
Optional: “Pin winner” (keep Slot A fixed, click a car to load Slot B).

Default load: last compared pair; else choose 2 recent “analysis ready” cars.
Avoid multi-car compare by default; if needed, make it an Advanced mode.


If you tell me whether you want Dipstick It to be strictly 2-car forever (my recommendation), I’ll propose the exact UI layout and copy for the slot picker + recents + pin-winner.
