This Projected Future Repairs page is very close to what Jason wanted — and you actually have the two “wow” visuals he praised:

Risk Urgency Map ✅

Survivability Curve / failure probability curves ✅
He explicitly liked both of these in the transcript.

And you also implemented the recall workflow:

“Open Recall Detected” + Validate Recall Completion ✅
That matches the recall option he wanted built in.

So overall: Yes, this page is good.

What’s off / what I’d fix (based on what he asked for)
1) The “Repair Evidence” block name/placement is slightly wrong

He didn’t want a standalone “Evidence” concept; he said remove the Evidence tab and embed service history analysis under routine maintenance gap analysis and repair projection. 

Dipstick v2 round

You did embed it (good), but the header “Repair Evidence” is still basically “Evidence” rebranded. That may trigger the same objection.

Fix: rename + tighten the purpose

Rename “Repair Evidence” → “Service History Signals” or “Historical Signals”

Add a 1–2 sentence line: “Past records that increase/decrease confidence in projected repair risk.”

2) Make the filters match the intent of this tab

Right now your legend/filter shows Maintenance / Inspection / Repair — that’s great, but on this page you probably want the default filter to highlight repairs + anomalies that support the risk forecast.

Fix:

Default filter on this tab: Repair + Inspection (or “All signals”)

Add quick chips: “Show only anomalies”, “Show gaps”, “Show repeats”

3) Tie the risk forecast to the evidence automatically

You have “3 high probability failures detected” at the top, but the evidence list below isn’t clearly connected.

Fix: “Evidence for this forecast” sublist
Directly under the risk forecast banner, add:

“Why we think this is high risk:”

“Service gap 2019–2022” (link scrolls to those items)

“Repeated ‘visual inspection only’ notes” (link)

“No record of X replacement by 72k miles” (link)

This creates the “train of thinking” inside the single-car page (which was a big theme overall).

4) Recall validation needs a status state (even mocked)

Right now the CTA exists. Great. But it needs to return a status like:

“Not verified” → “Verification in progress” → “Verified complete” / “Likely incomplete”

That’s aligned with the recall “validate completion” intent. 

Dipstick v2 round

Quick Replit note (copy/paste)
Projected Future Repairs is mostly correct and includes the “wow” visuals Jason praised (Risk Urgency Map + Survivability Curve) and the Recall CTA.

Improvements:
- Rename “Repair Evidence” to “Service History Signals” (avoid “Evidence” concept).
- Default filters on this tab should highlight repair/anomaly signals.
- Add “Evidence for this forecast” bullets that deep-link to the relevant timeline rows.
- Add recall validation status states (Not verified / Checking / Verified complete / Likely incomplete).
