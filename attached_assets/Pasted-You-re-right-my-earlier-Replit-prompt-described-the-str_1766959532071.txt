You’re right — my earlier Replit prompt described the **structure**, but it didn’t include the **actual numbers/text from Jason’s screenshots**. Replit won’t infer any of that unless we **spell it out**.

So here’s what I’m going to do for you:

1. I’m going to **type out the demo flow** (original) + the **revamped flow** (improved).
2. I’m going to include a **“DATA PACK”** pulled directly from your screenshots (the real values).
3. I’m going to give you a **Replit prompt** that tells it to build the UI with **mock data that matches Jason’s demo numbers** so you can show him a legit redesign.

# The demo flow (Jason’s original prototype journey)

**Start → finish, as shown in your screenshots**

* Trim: **4.0T QUATTRO**
* Engine: **4.0L V8 F DOHC 32V**
* VIN: **WAUW2AFC9FN008411**
* Upload “Service History PDF” → click **Parse**
* Success message: “**PDF parsed successfully! 44 service records found. Vehicle info auto-populated…**”

2. **Parsed Service History**

* Title: “Parsed Service History (**44 records**)”
* Table columns: Date, Mileage, Service Type, Description, Location, Cost

# The improved world-class flow (same engine, better packaging)

**Garage → Report Summary → Leverage Script → Costs (visual) → Evidence → Compare Winner**

* Garage shows cards with the same computed values (TCO, loss, risk, condition, deal score).
* Report Summary shows the *verdict* + top leverage issues first (not raw tables).
* Leverage builder creates the negotiation script + target offer.
* Costs tab shows the depreciation curve with markers + TCO breakdown chart.
* Evidence tab links every leverage item back to filtered service rows.
* Compare is charts + winner banner; the wide acronym tables go under “Advanced”.

# ✅ Replit prompt with the real screenshot data (copy/paste)

Paste this into Replit AI:

```text
Build a Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript app called “Dipstick” (Used Car Negotiation Leverage Platform).
This is a UI redesign of an existing prototype demo. You must implement BOTH:
(1) DEMO MODE (original module-first pages) and
(2) DTC MODE (world-class decision-first journey).
Use Tailwind + shadcn/ui + Recharts + TanStack Table + lucide-react.
Use mock data that EXACTLY matches the demo values listed below so we can present this redesign to a stakeholder.

BRAND
“Maverick + Trustworthy Innovator”:
- premium dark header, clean layout, bold accent color
- conventional risk colors: green/yellow/red
- microcopy should be bold but evidence-based (“Leverage you can prove”, “Evidence linked below”, “Based on 44 records”).

GLOBAL
Top header: Dipstick + toggle: [DTC Mode] [Demo Mode]
In DTC Mode: hide admin buttons like “Delete Section”.
In Demo Mode: you may show “Delete Section” inside a “Debug” accordion.

DATA PACK (MUST MATCH DEMO)
Create /lib/mockData.ts with at least TWO vehicles:
A) 2015 Audi S7 4.0T QUATTRO
- id: "audi-s7-2015"
- year 2015, make Audi, model S7, trim "4.0T QUATTRO"
- engine "4.0L V8 F DOHC 32V"
- vin "WAUW2AFC9FN008411"
- mileage 72300
- parsedServiceHistoryCount: 44
- parseSuccessMessage: "PDF parsed successfully! 44 service records found. Vehicle info auto-populated above. Please verify and edit if needed."

Service history (include at least these exact first rows):
1) 2014-08-30 | mileage null | Manufacturing | "Vehicle manufactured and shipped to original dealer" | location "-" | cost null
2) 2014-08-30 | mileage null | Purchase | "Vehicle purchase reported" | location "Ohio Motor Vehicle Dept." | cost null
3) 2014-09-11 | mileage null | Registration | "Title issued or updated, Registration issued or renewed, First owner reported" | location "Chagrin Falls, OH" | cost null
4) 2014-11-26 | mileage null | Registration | "Registration issued or renewed" | location "Chagrin Falls, OH" | cost null
5) 2015-01-21 | mileage 5364 | Maintenance | "5,000 mile service performed" | location "Audi of Bedford" | cost null
6) 2015-05-14 | mileage 7457 | Tire Service | "Tire condition and pressure checked" | location "Audi of Bedford" | cost null
7) 2015-11-23 | mileage 11795 | Inspection | "Maintenance inspection completed, Tire condition and pressure checked" | location "Audi of Bedford" | cost null
Add additional mocked records to reach 44 total.

- mileage shown in compare results: 72,176
Use compare numbers exactly below.
(You can mock the other module pages for this car, but compare outputs must match.)

PAGES / MODES
DTC MODE (default):
- / (Garage): show vehicle cards with scores and top leverage bullets.
- /add: upload + parsing stepper (fake).
- /report/[id]: tabs Summary | Leverage | Costs | Evidence | Advanced
   Summary shows the verdict first, Leverage builds a negotiation script (copy), Costs shows depreciation curve + TCO breakdown chart, Evidence shows timeline + filtered table.
- /compare: world-class compare (winner banner + charts) BUT also include an “Advanced Tables” accordion that renders the exact demo compare tables.

DEMO MODE:
- /demo/[id] should mimic original left-sidebar module flow: Vehicle Info/Parse → Parsed Service History → Service History Analysis → Routine Maintenance → Unscheduled Forecast → Gap Analysis → Risk Evaluation → Market Valuation → TCO → Comparator (selection + results tables).

CHARTS (must implement)
- Depreciation curve line chart with retail + private lines and tooltip.
- TCO breakdown stacked bar per vehicle.
- Compare charts: stacked bar TCO per vehicle + total loss bar.

EVIDENCE LINKING (trust mechanism)
- Each leverage item has “evidence tags” that filter/highlight evidence table rows.
- Default filter hides admin rows (registration/title) until user toggles “Show admin”.

OUTPUT
Generate all files and code so app runs without errors. Use the data pack above exactly.

## Why this fixes your problem

* Replit now has **the actual demo data**, not a generic template.
* You can show Jason:

  * “This matches your demo outputs 1:1”
  * “Here’s the redesigned packaging that makes it sellable DTC.”

If you want, I can also generate a **ready-to-paste `mockData.ts`** (full JSON) matching everything above — but the prompt above usually gets Replit to generate it correctly because it’s explicit with the values.
