People will click it, yes. The “sued by CARFAX” part depends on how you handle the PDF and what you claim, but you can dramatically reduce risk with a few clear product + legal-safe choices.

I’m not a lawyer, but here’s the practical playbook.

The real risk isn’t “uploading a PDF”

Users can upload files they legally have. The bigger risk is:

You scrape CARFAX, circumvent access controls, or automate retrieval from CARFAX without permission.

You reproduce/distribute CARFAX reports (share/export the PDF, re-host it, or generate a “CARFAX-like report” that copies their layout/content).

You imply affiliation: “Upload CARFAX” can read like an official integration.

Make it safer (recommended changes)
1) Change the button label (most important)

Instead of: “Add Vehicle (Upload PDF)” with “Upload CARFAX” elsewhere, use:

Add Vehicle
Then inside the modal:

“Upload vehicle history report (PDF) — e.g., CARFAX”
This avoids looking like an official CARFAX feature.

2) Don’t store or redistribute the original report

Safer patterns:

Process locally in-browser and only store extracted structured data (events, mileage, dates).

Or if you store the PDF, keep it private to the user, never shareable, never downloadable from you.

Avoid:

“Generate PDF report” that includes CARFAX text/images.

“Share full report” that shares the CARFAX document.

3) Don’t call it “CARFAX Report” anywhere in exports

Your “Generate PDF report” should be your own analysis summary, not a repackaging of CARFAX content.

4) Add a simple disclaimer in the upload modal

Something like:

“Upload a vehicle history report you own/have rights to use (e.g., a CARFAX PDF you purchased).”

“Dipstick is not affiliated with CARFAX.”

5) Avoid using CARFAX branding

No CARFAX logo, no “CARFAX integration,” no color scheme/phrasing that implies partnership.

6) Give a VIN option (also reduces CARFAX dependence)

As we discussed:

VIN = “fast start”

PDF upload = “best results”
This also de-risks the user flow and makes your product less dependent on a single vendor.

Will users click the Garage button?

Yes. But change it from a long, specific CTA to:

Add Vehicle
and make the garage “+ tile” also open the same wizard.

Copy/paste safe spec for Replit
Change Garage CTA from “Add Vehicle (Upload PDF)” to “Add Vehicle”.

In modal:
- Option: “Upload vehicle history report (PDF) (recommended)”
  Helper: “Works with reports like CARFAX, AutoCheck, dealer service PDFs.”
- Option: “Enter VIN (fast start)”
- Add disclaimer text:
  “Upload reports you own/have rights to use. Dipstick is not affiliated with CARFAX.”
- Do not re-host/share the original PDF publicly; exports should be Dipstick analysis only, not a reproduction of the report content.
- Avoid CARFAX logos/branding in UI.


If you tell me whether you’re currently storing the uploaded PDFs server-side or just parsing them client-side, I’ll tell you which approach is lower risk and what copy to use.
