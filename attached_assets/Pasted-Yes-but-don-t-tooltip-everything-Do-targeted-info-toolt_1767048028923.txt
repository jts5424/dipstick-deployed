Yes — but don’t tooltip everything. Do targeted “info” tooltips only where a normal buyer won’t instantly understand what they’re looking at, and where misunderstanding would change their decision.

In your screenshot, you should add hover/info in 4 places:

1) Fair Price Range (needs explanation)

People will ask: “Range based on what? Private or retail? Why this range?”

Add ⓘ tooltip:

“Estimated fair private-party price range for this vehicle given mileage/market comps. Use it to sanity-check the asking price. It’s an estimate, not a guarantee.”

2) 3-Year Low (needs explanation)

People will assume it’s “the lowest anyone will sell” or a guaranteed floor.

Tooltip:

“Historical low estimate over the last ~3 years for similar listings. Useful as a negotiation anchor, not a promise.”

3) Retail / Private Party / Trade-In (needs explanation)

Users mix these up constantly.

Tooltip for each card:

Retail: “Typical dealer list price.”

Private party: “Typical direct-to-seller price.”

Trade-in: “What a dealer may offer you if you trade it in.”

Optional: add a one-line microcopy under the 3 cards:
“Dealer prices are usually highest; trade-in is usually lowest.”

4) Depreciation curve + “ownership horizon” (def needs explanation)

This is the biggest “confusion risk.”

Add:

A small ⓘ next to “Projected Depreciation”

Tooltip:

“This shows estimated resale value over time. ‘You are here’ is current mileage. The red dot is your ownership horizon (3 yrs @ 12k/yr).”

Also add “How to read” below the chart (you already do this elsewhere) but keep it short:

“Steeper drop = faster value loss. Compare where you land at the horizon.”

How to implement without clutter
Use this pattern:

Title + small ⓘ icon (hover/click opens tooltip)

Tooltips should be 1–2 sentences max

On mobile: ⓘ becomes tap-to-open

Where NOT to add tooltips:

Don’t add tooltips for obvious numbers like “$35,500” unless it’s ambiguous what it represents (it isn’t).

Replit copy/paste spec
Add targeted info tooltips (ⓘ) only to ambiguous concepts:
- Fair Price Range: what it represents + estimate disclaimer
- 3-Year Low: what it means + “anchor not promise”
- Retail/Private/Trade-in: plain-English definitions
- Depreciation chart: explain “You are here” + ownership horizon dot + how to read

Tooltips: max 2 sentences, tap-to-open on mobile. Avoid tooltip spam.


If you want, I’ll write the exact tooltip copy for each element in your UI tone (short, confident, not legal-y).
