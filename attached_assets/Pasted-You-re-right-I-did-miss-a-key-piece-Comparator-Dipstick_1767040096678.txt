You’re right — I **did miss a key piece**:

### Comparator (“Dipstick It”) needs an **Executive Summary at the top**

This was explicitly said: “in comparator… it’s like the **executive summary** and then it goes into the **dipstick score**… there’s no train of thinking in the comparator.”  

I previously described “narrative + graphs,” but I didn’t explicitly call out that **the premise/structure is: Executive Summary → Dipstick Score → Train-of-thinking → Graphs**.

Below is the **corrected comparator spec** you can hand to Replit.

---

## ✅ “Dipstick It” (Comparator) — Correct Premise + Page Structure

### 0) Inputs (top strip)

* Car selection shown as **small thumbnails + labels** (NOT big cards). 
* Ownership Period + Annual Mileage inputs
* Big **Compare** button (runs the calc)

---

## 1) Executive Summary (must exist)

**Purpose:** give the “so what” instantly before graphs. 

**UI:** a compact summary panel (not “garage cards”)

* **Winner / Lean** (e.g., “Leans S7”)
* **Dipstick Score (each car)** (or a single “better buy” score + deltas)
* **Δ 3-Year TCO** (difference)
* **Δ Depreciation** (difference)
* **Δ Projected Repairs** (difference)
* **Risk delta** (optional, but clean)

This is still consistent with “no cards in comparator” because the intent was **no big garage-style inventory cards** / no scroll bloat — not “no summary block.”  

---

## 2) “Train of thinking” narrative (must exist)

Explicit requirement: comparator is missing the “train of thinking” and should be a high-level narrative.  

**Copy style:** interpretation, not advice (“it can’t be advice… it’ll be an interpretation”). 

**Format suggestion:**

* 3–5 bullet “why” statements
* plus a 2–3 sentence plain-English paragraph

---

## 3) Graphs (the proof)

You already had most of this, but here’s the **complete** graph requirement:

### A) Depreciation chart: BOTH curves on one chart + “you are here” markers

“Both curves stacked… showing you are here and you are here.” 

### B) Total Cost of Ownership graph below

“Total cost of ownership… graph below too.” 

### C) Cost breakdown bars (depreciation/maintenance/repairs)

Keep the engineering-style stacked bars — explicitly praised. 

### D) Graph explainers (tooltips / “how to read”)

“We need to explain the graphs… explain charts in a tooltip.”  

---

## Comparator “don’ts” (still true)

* Don’t show big garage cards in comparator or force scrolling past inventory. 
* Comparator should be “data in your face” + narrative + graphs that back it up.

## Replit-ready instruction (copy/paste)

**“Update Dipstick It (Comparator) page to this order:**

1. inputs + Compare CTA
2. Executive Summary panel (winner + dipstick score(s) + key deltas)
3. Train-of-thinking narrative (interpretation, not advice)
4. Charts: stacked depreciation curves w/ markers → TCO graph → cost breakdown bars
5. Tooltips/how-to-read for each chart
   **Remove big garage-style cards from comparator; keep only small thumbnails/labels.”**  

If you want, paste your current comparator component tree (or routes), and I’ll map this to **exact components to create** (e.g., `ComparatorExecutiveSummary.tsx`, `ComparatorNarrative.tsx`) + acceptance criteria.
