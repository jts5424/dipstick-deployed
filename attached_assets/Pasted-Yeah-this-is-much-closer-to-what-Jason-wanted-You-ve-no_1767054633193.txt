Yeah — this is much closer to what Jason wanted. You’ve now got the three pillars he kept asking for:

Executive summary / insight layer (your “Smart Analysis” + drivers)

Graphs as proof (depreciation + cost breakdown + report card)

Chart explainers (Simple/Technical toggle + “what you’re looking at / what it means”)

That directly matches his “narrative + graphs + explain the graphs” requirement.

But to be truly “Jason-perfect,” you still need 4 tweaks:

1) Fix the “stats truth” in the Smart Analysis block

Your Smart Analysis says “S7 retains 78% of its value…” and “fastest depreciating…” — that’s the kind of claim that will feel made up unless it’s computed from the chart.

Rule: every line in Smart Analysis must be backed by a number you can show (delta at horizon, % retained, $ saved). Otherwise it reads like marketing.

Do:

“At 3 years, S7 is projected to be worth $X more.”

“S7 total 3-year cost is $1,605 less.”

“Repair risk delta: $840 lower.”

2) Make “Key Drivers for Winner” evidence-linked

Jason didn’t want the compare tool to dump deep data, but he did want it to be credible.

Add “View evidence” links on each driver:

Value loss → jumps to depreciation chart

Repair risk → jumps to breakdown / risk section

Service gaps → jumps to per-car vehicle history tab

This keeps compare clean but verifiable.

3) Depreciation curves need the “You are here” / horizon markers (even in Top 4)

He repeatedly wanted the curves to show “you are here” markers tied to the ownership/mileage assumption. In your current chart, it’s just lines.

Add:

marker for Year 0 (today)

marker at Year N (horizon)

tooltip shows $ at horizon

That’s a signature “Dipstick” mechanic.

4) Hide the “Comparison Report Card” label (rename it)

“Comparison Report Card” sounds like a PDF section.
Rename to something human:

Report Card

Quick Scorecard

Category Breakdown

Bottom line

✅ Yes — this is basically the shape he wanted.
To finish it, make it more deterministic + evidence-linked + markers on the curve.

If you want, paste the current computed values you have for:

value at horizon per car

total 3-year cost per car

repair exposure per car
…and I’ll rewrite the Smart Analysis text so it’s 100% grounded and never “marketing-y.”
