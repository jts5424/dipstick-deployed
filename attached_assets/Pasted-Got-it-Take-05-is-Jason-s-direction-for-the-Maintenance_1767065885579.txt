Got it — Take-05 is Jason’s direction for the Maintenance Schedule + Immediate Maintenance Due pages.

Here’s everything he said, turned into the exact Replit edit spec.

Jason’s full direction (Take-05)
1) Combine the two pages/sections into one

“We want to combine maintenance schedule and immediate maintenance due.” 

jason-fred-take-05

He confirms: “the last one and this one should be combined into one.” 

jason-fred-take-05

Replit instruction: merge Maintenance Schedule + Immediate Maintenance Due into a single tab/section.

2) Purpose of the maintenance schedule = enable gap analysis (not just show a list)

The maintenance schedule exists so you can do a gap analysis of the car’s service history vs the OEM or independent expert schedule.

Replit instruction: don’t frame this as “here’s the schedule.” Frame it as “here’s what’s due based on schedule vs your history.”

3) Show results relative to the schedule (not relative to the history)

“When we perform that gap analysis, we show it relative to the schedule, not relative to the maintenance history.” 

jason-fred-take-05

Replit instruction: the UI baseline is the schedule (expected intervals). Service history is the evidence used to compute “last done” and “due.”

4) For every routine item: last done + due as of today

For each routine maintenance item:

When was the last time it was done?

When is it due as of today (based on that last done + the interval) 

jason-fred-take-05

Replit instruction: each maintenance row/card must include:

Last done (miles/date)

Due at (miles/date)

Miles remaining (or overdue by)

5) Break down each specific item (oil change, air filter, etc.)

He explicitly agrees to breaking down “each specific one” like oil change, air filter replacement, etc. 

jason-fred-take-05

Replit instruction: do not lump items into generic categories—list them item-by-item.

6) Add urgency cards with color + cost

He wants “urgency cards” that float items to the top:

Past due → pops up at top, shows item + cost

Due soon (next couple thousand miles) → yellow

Down the road → green 

jason-fred-take-05

Replit instruction:
Top of page = “Urgency” stack:

Red: Past due

Yellow: Due soon (≤ ~2,000 miles) (he said “next couple thousand miles”)

Green: Later

Each card shows:

Item name

Due status (Overdue / Due soon / Later)

Estimated cost

Replit-ready page structure (paste this)

Tab name: Maintenance (or “Maintenance & Due Now”)

Urgency Cards (auto-sorted)

Past Due (red)

Due Soon (yellow)

Later (green)

Maintenance Schedule Gap Analysis (full list)

For each item:

Interval source: OEM / Indy Expert

Last done (from history)

Due now? (computed)

Due at mileage/date + miles remaining

Estimated cost

Optional toggles:

Show: All | Due only

Sort: Urgency | Category | Cost

If you upload Take-06, I’ll keep stacking these into one “Jason spec doc” so you can implement page-by-page without missing anything.
