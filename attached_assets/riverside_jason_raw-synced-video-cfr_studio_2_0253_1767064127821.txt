00:00:12 SPK1
Yeah, so the, the idea here is to show

00:00:16 SPK1
like high level the abstractions

00:00:20 SPK1
from all the other tabs in the most concise way possible for

00:00:25 SPK1
the user. The executive summary is, is pretty right on.

00:00:30 SPK1
I think we need a dialog box to,

00:00:34 SPK1
or a user input box for the

00:00:37 SPK1
cost here, like above Executive summary or within executive

00:00:41 SPK1
summary somewhere. Because it says fairly priced, but there's

00:00:45 SPK1
no place to actually put in the price. The,

00:00:51 SPK1
the cost of ownership is. It looks really good and

00:00:58 SPK1
the risk evaluation should be adjusted.

00:01:02 SPK1
Instead of just looking at risk. This is

00:01:07 SPK1
really just saying like repairs here. I think it would be better to look

00:01:11 SPK1
at this as a, as a timeline, a cost timeline

00:01:15 SPK1
that shows either from 0 miles on

00:01:19 SPK1
or, you know, today's date on how

00:01:26 SPK1
the cumulative cost that accrues as

00:01:31 SPK1
the user would drive it or own it and time is going on.

00:01:34 SPK1
So like if you have, if we're at zero miles today, they buy it today

00:01:39 SPK1
and when they take it off the lot, they have

00:01:43 SPK1
to immediately they have to do an oil change that should be reflected as

00:01:47 SPK1
like a step, a step change in the cost. And then say

00:01:51 SPK1
10, 10,000 miles down the, down the road,

00:01:55 SPK1
they need to do another oil change that should be reflected in the cost.

00:01:58 SPK1
So a cumulative line chart showing

00:02:03 SPK1
the cost increasing throughout time that way.

00:02:06 SPK1
That way they can look at, if I

00:02:10 SPK1
buy the car today and I own it for this amount of time, I'm going

00:02:13 SPK1
to accrue this cost and I'm okay with that. But my

00:02:17 SPK1
probability of accruing a lot more costs with an extra 10,000 miles is

00:02:22 SPK1
too much. So they can look at it and they can say, all right,

00:02:25 SPK1
this car, if I buy it and I drive it for 20,000 miles, my probability

00:02:29 SPK1
of cost of ownership is really low. But at 40,000,

00:02:34 SPK1
it skyrockets. So now they know, all right, I should only own this for

00:02:39 SPK1
20, 30,000 miles. It.

00:03:07 SPK1
No, I think that's good.
