Because right now you’re doing the right product pattern: parsing ≠ saving.

Parsing extracts data, but you still need a confirmation + save step so users can:

verify mileage (often wrong or missing),

add VIN (for recall validation),

correct trim/engine,

avoid creating junk vehicles in Garage.

That said: you can make it feel instant without losing control.

What you should do (best UX)
After parse success, show this confirm screen briefly…

…and then give users two choices:

Save & build analysis (primary, already there)

Save & go to Garage (secondary)

Also add an “auto-redirect” option

After they click Save & build analysis, do:

toast: “Vehicle saved. Building analysis…”

auto-redirect to Garage after 1–2 seconds

Because users expect to end up back in Garage with the new car card showing “Processing…”

Why “auto-go to Garage immediately after parse” is risky

If you auto-create a vehicle on parse:

you’ll fill Garage with half-baked records when parsing fails

you’ll lose the chance to fix mileage/VIN

users won’t trust your outputs

So: don’t auto-save on parse. Auto-save on Save & build.

What you’re missing right now (based on your screenshot)
1) You’re labeling VIN as Optional — should be “Recommended”

You already say “We’ll use this for recall validation,” but label should match: VIN (recommended).

2) Your locked fields need an “Edit” affordance

You show lock icons, but users need a way to override:

“Edit” link next to locked fields

Replit copy/paste spec
Keep confirm step after parse (parse ≠ save), but improve flow:

- On “Save & build analysis”:
  1) Save vehicle
  2) Start analysis job
  3) Redirect to Garage automatically + show “Processing…” badge on the new vehicle card

- Add secondary button: “Save & go to Garage” (no build) OR keep one button and always redirect to Garage after save.

- Don’t redirect to Garage immediately after parse success unless vehicle is saved.
- Change label to “VIN (recommended)” and add an “Edit” affordance for locked fields.


If you want it to feel even more “instant”: show a Garage preview card on this page right after parse (“This is what will appear in your Garage”), then Save confirms it and returns.
