You’re correct — in my last message I described the merge, but I didn’t give you the actual merged IA + component spec you can drop into Replit.

Here it is: one combined page that merges “Maintenance Schedule” + “Immediate Maintenance Due” exactly the way Jason describes: “the last one and this one should be combined into one”

 and “Immediate maintenance due should be infused with the maintenance schedule”

✅ MERGED PAGE SPEC (Replit-ready)
Tab / Route

Tab name: Maintenance
Route: /compare/:id/maintenance

This replaces:

Maintenance Schedule page

Immediate Maintenance Due page

Page Goal (Jason’s intent)

Show a gap analysis of service history vs OEM/Indy schedule, and present results relative to the schedule (schedule is baseline), not relative to history.

Top-level layout (in order)
Section A — “Urgency Cards” (this is the “Immediate Due” part, merged into the same page)

Jason wants urgency cards that surface past due / due soon / later items at the top. 

jason-fred-take-05

A1) Past Due (Red)

Title: Past Due

Card per item:

Item name (Oil Change, Air Filter, etc.)

Overdue by: X miles or X days

Estimated cost: $__ (Jason explicitly wants cost on the card) 

jason-fred-take-05

CTA: View details → scrolls to that item in the schedule list

A2) Due Soon (Yellow)

Title: Due Soon

Definition: due in next couple thousand miles 

jason-fred-take-05

Card shows:

Due in: ~X miles

Estimated cost

A3) Later (Green)

Title: Down the road

Card shows:

Due in: ~X miles

Estimated cost

NOTE: This is your “Immediate Maintenance Due” content — it’s not a separate page anymore.

Section B — “Maintenance Schedule Gap Analysis” (the schedule list)

Jason’s abstraction: for every routine item in the schedule:

when was it last done?

when is it due as of today based on history + interval 

jason-fred-take-05

B0) Controls

Toggle: Show: All | Due only

Sort: Urgency | Cost | Name

Filter (optional but helpful): System (Engine / Brakes / Fluids / Filters...)

B1) Row/Card structure (repeat for each item)

Each maintenance item must be broken out specifically (oil change, air filter, etc.) 

jason-fred-take-05

Fields per item card:

Item name (e.g., Oil Change)

Interval baseline (the “schedule”):

Every 5,000 miles or Every 6 months

Source label: OEM or Indy Expert 

jason-fred-take-05

Last done:

Last done: 62,100 mi (Service record)

If unknown: No record found

Due calculation (as of today):

Due at: 67,100 mi

Current: 70,000 mi

Status pill: Past due / Due soon / Later

Delta: Overdue by 2,900 mi or Due in 1,800 mi

Estimated cost: $__ (same cost value used for urgency cards)

Expand/collapse details:

“Matched service records” list (dates/miles/notes)

Key rule (Jason): the display is “relative to the schedule” — meaning the interval is the anchor, and history only populates “last done” and computes due.

Data/logic requirements (minimal, Replit-friendly)
Inputs

currentMileage

scheduleItems[] (from OEM/Indy schedule)

id, name, intervalMiles?, intervalMonths?, estCost, source

serviceHistory[]

date, mileage, description, tags[]

Computation per item

Find last relevant service record → lastDoneMileage/date

Compute due:

if intervalMiles: dueMileage = lastDoneMileage + intervalMiles

else if intervalMonths: dueDate = lastDoneDate + intervalMonths

Determine status:

PastDue if currentMileage > dueMileage (or today > dueDate)

DueSoon if dueMileage - currentMileage <= 2000 (Jason’s “couple thousand”) 

jason-fred-take-05

else Later

Generate urgency cards from same computed list (group by status)

Copy/paste note you can drop in Replit prompt

“Merge Maintenance Schedule + Immediate Maintenance Due into one ‘Maintenance’ page. Top = urgency cards (Past Due red with cost, Due Soon yellow within 2,000 miles with cost, Down the road green). Below = schedule-based gap analysis list where each maintenance item shows schedule interval (OEM/Indy), last done, due as of today, status, miles overdue/remaining, and estimated cost. The schedule is the baseline; history only supports last done + due calculation.”
