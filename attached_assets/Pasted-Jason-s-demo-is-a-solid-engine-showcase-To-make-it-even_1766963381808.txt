Jason’s demo is a solid engine showcase. To make it even better (and truer to what he actually said) you upgrade 6 things: home screen logic, comparator tiles, the analyze stepper, evidence trust, the “$ you’ll lose” framing, and the survivability/depreciation visuals. Here’s the exact delta.

1) Make Comparator the only “home” (harder than you think)

Jason wasn’t “also want a garage.” He explicitly wanted the comparator to be the base page where everything starts.

Better: Don’t make “Garage” and “Comparator.” Make Comparator = Garage.

Upgrade UI

Home = a grid of vehicle tiles

Top bar = ownership assumptions (years + miles/year)

One primary CTA = Analyze

Everything else is drill-down

This makes the UX feel intentional, not like a dashboard with random pages.

2) Vehicle tiles must scream “$ you’ll lose” + 2 bullets (Jason’s exact framing)

He literally said the comparator should show “how much money you’re going to lose” and then you click a tile to drill down.

Better tile layout

Big number: $6,675
Label: “Total loss (3 yrs)”

Smaller: “3-yr TCO: $8,675”

Risk chip: LOW/MOD/HIGH

Condition score chip

2 bullets (from analysis):

“Significant service gaps (2019–2022)”

“Mileage missing on multiple records”

Button: View leverage (not “open report”)

Now the home screen is the product.

3) The Analyze experience should unlock modules progressively (not just “run”)

Jason wanted a spinner/stepper where sections become available as they finish.

Better stepper
When you hit Analyze:

show a vertical stepper with checkmarks:

Parse records ✅

Service narrative ⏳

OEM schedule ⏳

Unscheduled forecast ⏳

Gap analysis ⏳

Risk eval ⏳

Market valuation ⏳

TCO ✅

And as each step completes, the corresponding tile bullets update live.

That feels “innovator,” not static.

4) Surivivability curve toggle for unscheduled maintenance (Jason called it out)

He said unscheduled should eventually be a survivability curve.

Better
On “Unscheduled Maintenance”:

Default view: top 8 cards (soonest/highest risk)

Toggle: Table | Curve

Curve:

X = mileage

Y = failure probability

Shaded “risk window”

“You are here” marker at current mileage

This is one of the few visuals that will instantly make Jason go: “Yeah, that’s it.”

5) Risk evaluation must subtract “already fixed” (he explicitly described this logic)

He described reducing risk if it’s in service history repairs.

Better
Every risk item card shows:

Status: Already fixed / No evidence

Evidence tags that jump to records

“Revised probability” (lower if fixed)
Even if the math is mocked, the UI must show the concept.

That’s how Dipstick differentiates from “generic repair list.”

6) Depreciation curve needs the “knee” storytelling (he cares about the curve shape)

He talked about depreciation being a “hockey stick” with a knee around ~40k miles. 

jason-fred

Better
Depreciation chart should have:

Two markers:

Current mileage

Projected mileage at end of ownership

Annotation on the curve:

“Depreciation knee (~40k)”

Toggle Retail | Private Party

A small “loss over horizon” callout under the chart

This turns valuation from “data” into “decision.”

7) Biggest “even better” layer Jason implied but didn’t demo: Negotiation leverage packaging

He called gap + risk the key differentiators vs Carfax.

The world-class move is turning those into a usable negotiation output:

Better
A “Leverage” drawer on every vehicle:

Selected issues

Running $ range

Script:

questions to ask

receipts to request

offer anchor

Jason’s prototype is analysis. This makes it a product.

8) Trustworthiness: evidence linking must be first-class

Jason’s whole pitch is: “We’re more useful than Carfax,” but to be trustworthy you have to show evidence.

Better trust features

Every leverage item has “Evidence tags”

Clicking them filters and highlights the service history table rows

Data quality card:

“Mileage missing on X records”

“Gap 2019–2022”

“Admin events hidden by default”

This gives “innovator” + “credible.”

The simplest “Jason-approved” upgrade summary

If you do only 3 upgrades, do these:

Comparator tiles with $ you’ll lose + 2 bullets (his exact home-screen vision) 

jason-fred

Analyze stepper that unlocks modules progressively 

jason-fred

Unscheduled Curve toggle (survivability)

That alone makes it feel “world class” compared to the prototype.

If you want, I’ll rewrite your Lovable/Replit prompt so it explicitly forces these Jason-specific “better” features (so the generator can’t skip them).
