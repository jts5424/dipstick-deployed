Cool — here’s the exact UI copy + states for both flows so Replit can implement without guessing. No provider names.

VIN Flow — UI copy + states
Screen title

Confirm VIN details
Subtitle: “We’ll decode the vehicle and enable recall checks.”

Fields (order matters)

VIN (required)
Placeholder: “17-character VIN”
Helper: “Used for recall validation and verification.”

VIN validation states

Empty / invalid length:
“VIN must be 17 characters.”

Decoding (spinner):
“Decoding VIN…”

Decoded (success):
✅ “VIN decoded: Audi • S7 • 2015”
(Show Make/Model/Year fields auto-filled below)

Make (auto-filled, locked)

Model (auto-filled, locked)

Year (auto-filled, locked)
Link next to locked fields: Edit (if user needs to override)

Current mileage (required)
Placeholder: “e.g., 84,000”
Helper: “Used for risk windows and depreciation.”

Trim (optional) (collapsed “More details”)

Engine (optional) (collapsed)

Banner (top of form)

Limited analysis until you upload a vehicle history report
“Upload a vehicle history report (PDF) to unlock full history, gaps, and risk insights.”

Primary CTA

Create vehicle

Secondary actions

Back

Link: Upload a PDF instead

Manual Entry Flow — UI copy + states
Screen title

Enter vehicle details
Subtitle: “Basic tracking. Add a VIN or PDF later for deeper analysis.”

Fields

Make (required)
Placeholder: “e.g., Audi”

Model (required)
Placeholder: “e.g., S7”

Year (required)
Placeholder: “e.g., 2015”

Current mileage (required)
Placeholder: “e.g., 84,000”

Trim (optional)

Engine (optional)

VIN (optional)
Label: “VIN (optional)”
Placeholder: “17-character VIN”
Helper (neutral): “Adding a VIN enables recall validation.”

VIN state (manual)

If VIN entered and valid: ✅ “VIN ready for recall checks.”

If VIN blank: show nothing (no warning).

Banner (top of form)

Basic mode
“Some insights will be limited until a vehicle history report (PDF) is uploaded.”

Primary CTA

Save vehicle

Secondary actions

Back

Link: Upload a PDF for best results

Important behavior rules (so they don’t drift back into being identical)

VIN flow: block CTA until VIN is valid AND mileage entered.

Manual flow: never show “recall validation requires a VIN” warning on this screen.

Only show recall warnings later when user tries to run recall validation without a VIN.

Replit “one-liner” to implement
VIN route = VIN required + decode + fewer required fields + CTA “Create vehicle”.
Manual route = VIN optional + no warning + more required fields + CTA “Save vehicle”.


If you want, I’ll also draft the PDF Parse confirm screen copy (third path) so all three feel coherent and intentional.
