Yep — this clip is more detailed, and it’s about the Projected Future Repairs / Survivability + Top Risks page, not the Executive Summary.

Here’s ALL the edit direction Jason gave in this “next” file, converted into a Replit-ready spec. 

jason-fred-take-04

Jason’s direction for this page (complete)
1) “Risk Urgency Map” — keep it (mostly)

Jason: “risk urgency map… really good.” 

jason-fred-take-04

He notes you previously said you’d modify it on the summary page, but on this page he thinks it’s good as-is (then he wavers briefly). 

jason-fred-take-04

Replit instruction: keep the Risk Urgency Map section on this page. Don’t delete it.

2) The real “meat” is Survivability (components)

He corrects himself: the “real way to look at this” is the survivability section below — that’s what you should really be showing. 

jason-fred-take-04

Replit instruction: visually prioritize survivability analysis as the primary content on the page (layout, spacing, headline weight, position).

3) Explain how to read the survivability chart (non-negotiable)

Jason describes what the survivability chart means:

It’s survivability analysis of components due to fail unscheduled (unscheduled maintenance). 

jason-fred-take-04

There’s a probability of failure at different mileage levels throughout the lifecycle. 

jason-fred-take-04

“We should definitely explain that so people understand how to read these charts.” 

jason-fred-take-04

Replit instruction: add a “How to read this” explainer directly above the chart (or an info tooltip that’s open by default on first view).

4) “Top Risks” tiles must be clickable → pop-up drilldown

Jason: the curves/tiles represent different failure modes and are congruent with the survivability curves. 

jason-fred-take-04

He wants interaction: click a box (e.g., water pump) → it explains what’s failing and why, and shows detail. 

jason-fred-take-04

Replit instruction: make each “Top Risk” tile a button that opens a modal/drawer.

5) Drilldown modal contents (this is the big spec)

When you click a component tile (example: Water Pump), the pop-up should include:

A) Component-specific survivability curve

“You could have the survivability of just that one on the pop-up.” 

jason-fred-take-04

B) Service history analysis specific to that component

He wants “a list of service records or a summary… as applicable to that failure.” 

jason-fred-take-04

Example logic he gives:

If water pump was replaced at 30k and car is 70k, call out:

it “failed early,” but was replaced, so restart the clock

the component effectively has 40k miles on it (not 70k) 

jason-fred-take-04

Mention maintenance that “reduces likelihood” of failure again 

jason-fred-take-04

Add usage context like low miles/year and what that implies (example: 40k miles over 8 years = not heavily driven). 

jason-fred-take-04

“Like an analysis of the service history relative to the water pump… have that for all of them.” 

jason-fred-take-04

Replit instruction: modal must include a “Service History Impact” block that is dynamic per component (positive/negative).

6) Remove “Service History Signals” box from this page

Jason: “I don’t think we need this box on this page.” 

jason-fred-take-04

Clarified: you do not need “service history signals” on the projected future repairs page. 

jason-fred-take-04

Instead, those signals should be baked into the failure mode cards when you click them. 

jason-fred-take-04

Replit instruction: delete the standalone “Service History Signals” section and relocate that content into each component modal (summary form is fine).

Replit-ready build checklist (copy/paste)
Page layout

Sections (top → bottom):

Risk Urgency Map (keep)

Survivability Analysis (make this the hero / primary)

Top Risks (clickable tiles)

Survivability section

Add “How to read this chart” explainer:

What “unscheduled maintenance” means

“Probability of failure vs mileage” concept

What higher probability zones imply

Top Risks tiles

Each tile opens ComponentDetailModal(componentId)

ComponentDetailModal (required blocks)

Header: Component name + risk score + “why it matters”

Mini survivability chart for that component only

“Why it fails” short explanation

Service History Impact (component-specific):

Last replacement date/mileage (if any)

“Restarted clock” miles-on-component calculation

Maintenance signals that reduce/increase risk

Driving pattern context (miles/year)

Net takeaway: “More likely / less likely than average”

Remove from page

Standalone “Service History Signals” box (bake it into the modal instead)

If you want, I can also turn this into exact UI copy (mom-friendly + technical toggle) for:

the survivability explainer

the tile hover states

the modal “Service History Impact” narrative template (auto-generated text)
