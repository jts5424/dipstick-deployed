Yes — it needs a “how to use this” hover (and honestly a tiny onboarding tip the first time). Right now “Objection Response Engine” is powerful but not self-explanatory. A user won’t know:

when to use it (before vs after objections),

how it connects to the script phases,

what “Pre-Butt Mode” actually does,

whether responses are customized to their selected points.

What it means (plain English)

Search: type what the seller/dealer said (e.g., “priced to market”).

The engine returns a ready reply that:

acknowledges (de-escalates),

uses your app’s evidence (selected leverage points),

asks a calibrated question,

offers a clean either/or close.

Pre-Butt Mode: it generates an “accusation audit / pre-empt” line you can add to your message before they object (ex: “You’re probably thinking I’m nitpicking…”).

That’s exactly what makes it feel bulletproof.

Yes: add a hover + micro-onboarding
1) Add an “ⓘ” info icon next to the header

Hover tooltip copy (tight):

How to use:

Type what they said (“priced to market”)

Copy the suggested reply (it uses your selected leverage points)

If Pre-Butt Mode is on, it adds a pre-empt line to reduce pushback

Click Add to Script to drop it into Phase 4: Objections

2) Add 2 inline cues so it’s obvious it’s connected

Under the search bar: “Powered by your selected points (4)”

On each objection card: chips like “Uses: Service Gaps, Immediate Liability”

3) Add “Add to Script” + “Copy Text/Email”

Your UI already looks like it has a response block — but make the actions explicit:

Copy as Text

Copy as Email

Insert into Phase 4: Objections

4) Rename “Pre-Butt Mode” label (optional but recommended)

“Pre-Butt” is insider talk. Users won’t get it.
Better:

Pre-empt objections
with a smaller sublabel:

“Adds a line that reduces defensiveness before you make your offer.”

Replit copy/paste spec
Add help UX for Objection Response Engine.

- Add info icon (ⓘ) next to header with hover tooltip explaining:
  search → reply generated from selected points → copy/insert → Pre-empt mode behavior.
- Show “Powered by selected points (N)” under search bar.
- On each objection response card, show chips: “Uses: <point names>”.
- Add explicit actions: Copy Text / Copy Email / Insert into Phase 4: Objections.
- Rename “Pre-Butt Mode” to “Pre-empt objections” with subtext explaining it.


If you want, I’ll write the exact tooltip + empty-state copy (when no objection is searched) so it feels polished.
