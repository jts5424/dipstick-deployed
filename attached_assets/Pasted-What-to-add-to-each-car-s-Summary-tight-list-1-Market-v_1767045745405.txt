What to add to each car’s Summary (tight list)
1) Market valuation roll-up (mini)

He explicitly referenced that the single-car analysis has market valuation (retail / private / trade) and that the Summary should include that concept as part of the culmination.

Dipstick v2 round

Add: a small 3-number strip or single “Fairly priced / Overpriced by $X” callout with:

Retail / Private / Trade (or just one “Fair price range” + delta)

“Asking vs Fair” delta

2) “Fair price range / 3-year low” snippet

He literally called out Summary having: dipstick score, fair price range, three-year low. 

Dipstick v2 round

Add: right near the deal score:

Fair price range: $X–$Y

3-year low benchmark: $Z

3) Issue severity breakdown (mini)

He said “issue severity breakdown — I love that.” 

Dipstick v2 round

Add: a compact severity bar/stack like:

Critical / Moderate / Low counts

Or “Immediate liability $X” + “Deferred $Y” split

4) Maintenance gaps count + $ exposure (not the timeline)

Summary should show routine maintenance gap analysis at a roll-up level, not the full service timeline. 

Dipstick v2 round

Add: one line:

“Service gaps detected: 2 (2019–2022)”

“Estimated deferred maintenance exposure: ~$X”

5) Recall status badge (if applicable)

You already implemented recall detection and “Validate recall completion” in Projected Future Repairs. On Summary, just a badge:

“Open recall detected” + link to validate.

This matches the recall workflow he wanted.

What NOT to add to Summary

Don’t paste the service history timeline/table into Summary (that belongs in Vehicle History / Maintenance tabs).

Don’t add the full survivability curve module in Summary (keep that in Projected Future Repairs).

Don’t add “Evidence” as a tab (he wanted it removed and embedded elsewhere).

Replit copy/paste spec for Summary
Per-car Summary must be the culmination:
- Keep Executive Summary narrative + 3-year cost breakdown + Risk Urgency Map.
- Add compact Market Valuation roll-up (Retail/Private/Trade OR fair price delta).
- Add Fair Price Range + 3-year low snippet near score.
- Add Issue Severity Breakdown mini (critical/moderate/low + immediate vs deferred $).
- Add Service gaps count + estimated exposure (roll-up only, no timeline).
- If recall exists: show Open Recall badge + link to Validate Recall Completion.
