ou’re not crazy — there are a few more concrete “Jason wanted this” details that should be in your Replit master spec, beyond what I already gave you.

Add these missing requirements
1) Comparator entry points (UX flows)

Keep BOTH ways to enter Dipstick It:

From Garage: “compare two vehicles” → it launches the comparator

From top nav: click Comparator/Dipstick It

2) Comparator inputs include Market Price per vehicle

He explicitly liked: “ownership period, annual mileage, market price for each one.”

3) Comparator should be a super quick run

After data is cached behind the car, compare should be “a super quick run.”

4) Garage cards MAY include “estimated total loss”

He called out Garage can have “cards and… estimated total loss” on the card.

5) “Configure analysis (3 years / 12,000)” + “Run full analysis” removal (explicit)

This is the exact phrasing of what to remove, not just the concept.

6) Dipstick It should NOT show “stats in the car” (full list of the clutter)

The specific stats called out as clutter on compare cards:

total loss, deal score, regular oil change, gap service, full report
and the directive: “don’t put the stats in the car.”

7) Script Builder bug is TWO separate bugs (not just scrolling)

Bug A: clicking Generate Script doesn’t pull up Smart Script Builder (state/trigger bug).

Bug B: modal can’t scroll at normal window size/zoom.

8) Where Leverage Builder lives in the UI (exact path + placement)

Path: Garage → View Analysis → Summary card → Leverage Builder “to the right” → Generate Script

9) “DTC mode” exists (don’t ignore it)

They referenced “You’re in DTC mode, right?” which implies your UI has modes or a toggle that affects where Leverage Builder shows up. Replit should ensure Leverage Builder/Script Builder is discoverable in that mode.
