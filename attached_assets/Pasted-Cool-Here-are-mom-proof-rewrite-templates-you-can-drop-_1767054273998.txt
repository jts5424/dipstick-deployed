Cool. Here are mom-proof rewrite templates you can drop in everywhere (Dipstick It + single-car tabs). They’re short, plain English, and always end with a “what to do.”

Global replacements (use these labels in UI)

TCO → 3-Year Cost

Depreciation → Value loss

Repair exposure → Risk of big repairs

Maintenance → Routine upkeep

Value retention → Holds value

Risk urgency map → Risk map

Survivability curve → Where breakdowns usually happen

Section headers:

How to read this → What you’re looking at

What it means → What it means for you

Add: Bottom line

Dipstick It (multi-car compare) — chart blocks
1) Value loss chart (Depreciation curves)

What you’re looking at:
“This shows how much each car is expected to be worth over time.”

What it means for you:

If one line ends higher, that car keeps more of its value.

If the lines are close, value loss isn’t the deciding factor.

Bottom line:
“Pick the car that keeps more value only if cost and repair risk are similar.”

Dynamic insert (optional):

If delta < $250: “These are basically tied.”

Else: “After {years} years, {winner} is worth about ${delta} more.”

2) 3-Year Cost breakdown (stacked bars)

What you’re looking at:
“This shows where your money goes over {years} years: value loss, routine upkeep, and repairs.”

What it means for you:

“{winner} costs about ${deltaTotal} less overall.”

“The biggest difference is {biggestDriver}.”

Bottom line:
“If you want to spend less over {years} years, pick {winner}.”

(If tied)
Bottom line: “Costs are basically the same — choose based on risk and history.”

3) Risk of big repairs (if you show it as a number)

What you’re looking at:
“This estimates how likely expensive repairs are.”

What it means for you:
“Lower is better — fewer surprise bills.”

Bottom line:
“If you hate surprises, pick the car with lower repair risk.”

4) Scorecard table

What you’re looking at:
“A quick report card. Higher is better.”

What it means for you:

“{winner} is stronger on {topCategory}.”

“{runnerUp} is stronger on {losingCategory}.”

Bottom line:
“Pick {winner} for {topCategory}. Pick {runnerUp} if {losingCategory} matters most.”

Single-car pages — mom-proof blocks
Summary

Replace any long narrative with:

1 sentence: “This car looks {good/fair/risky} at this price.”

2 bullets: “Top concern: ___” “Best sign: ___”

Bottom line: “If you buy it, plan to budget $X–$Y in the first year.”

Market Valuation

What you’re looking at:
“These are typical prices for similar cars.”

What it means for you:
“If the asking price is below the fair range, you have room to negotiate.”

Bottom line:
“Use ${delta} as your negotiation starting point.”

Projected Future Repairs (risk map)

What you’re looking at:
“Bigger dots mean bigger potential bills. Dots further left tend to happen sooner.”

What it means for you:
“Most risk is clustered around {mileageWindow} miles.”

Bottom line:
“Ask for proof those items were fixed, or plan to budget for them.”

Immediate Maintenance Due

What you’re looking at:
“Work you’ll probably have to pay for right away.”

What it means for you:
“These are real costs — not ‘maybe later.’”

Bottom line:
“Ask for ${total} off or ask them to fix these before purchase.”

Vehicle History (gaps)

What you’re looking at:
“A timeline of service and ownership events.”

What it means for you:
“A long gap usually means records are missing (work may have been done, but we can’t prove it).”

Bottom line:
“If there’s a big gap, negotiate for uncertainty or require receipts.”

One UI rule to keep it readable

Every explainer block should be:

2 short sentences max + 1 bottom line

No jargon

Always contains either:

one number, or

one clear action (“Ask for receipts”, “Budget $X”, “Negotiate $Y off”)

…and I’ll rewrite them line-by-line in this mom-proof style and keep your brand voice.

can you actually include both the techincal and everyday speak

Yes — best pattern is a toggle: Simple (default) and Technical (for power users). Don’t show both at once or it’ll feel bloated.

UI pattern

Under each chart:

Explain: Simple | Technical (Simple selected by default)

Keep it consistent across all charts.

Copy templates (you can reuse everywhere)
Depreciation Curves
Simple

What you’re looking at: “How much each car is expected to be worth over time.”
What it means for you: “Higher line = keeps value better.”
Bottom line: “If the lines are close, focus on total cost and repair risk.”

Technical

Definition: “Projected resale value trajectory across the ownership horizon.”
Interpretation: “Delta at year {Y} (horizon): ${Δvalue}. Slope reflects value loss rate.”
Bottom line: “Value loss contribution to TCO is primarily depreciation; use horizon deltas for ranking.”

3-Year Cost Breakdown (stacked bars)
Simple

What you’re looking at: “Where your money goes: value loss, upkeep, repairs.”
What it means for you: “Shorter bar = cheaper to own.”
Bottom line: “Pick the lowest total cost unless repair risk is unacceptable.”

Technical

Definition: “TCO decomposition: Depreciation + Routine Maintenance + Unscheduled Repairs.”
Interpretation: “Total ΔTCO vs #2 = ${Δtco}. Primary driver = {component} (Δ ${Δcomponent}).”
Bottom line: “Component deltas explain ranking sensitivity.”

Risk (repairs)
Simple

What you’re looking at: “Chance of expensive repairs.”
What it means for you: “Lower risk = fewer surprise bills.”
Bottom line: “If you hate surprises, choose lower repair risk even if cost is similar.”

Technical

Definition: “Projected failure probability zones by mileage window + cost impact.”
Interpretation: “Highest-probability window: {range}. Exposure estimate: ${risk$}.”
Bottom line: “Risk-adjusted TCO favors lower exposure if user risk tolerance is low.”

Scorecard table
Simple

What you’re looking at: “Quick report card. Higher is better.”
What it means for you: “Shows what each car is best at.”
Bottom line: “Use this to pick based on your priorities.”

Technical

Definition: “Normalized category scores (0–100) across value retention, reliability, maintenance economy, condition, deal rating.”
Interpretation: “Winner leads in {k} of {n} categories; weakness is {weakCat}.”
Bottom line: “Use category weighting if user preference differs from default.”

Replit copy/paste spec
For every chart, add an “Explain” toggle:
- Simple (default): 2 short sentences + Bottom line
- Technical: definition + 1 numeric delta + Bottom line

Do not show both at once. Persist user preference across the app.


If you paste your current “How to read / What it means” strings, I’ll convert each one into Simple + Technical versions with your actual numbers/deltas filled in.
