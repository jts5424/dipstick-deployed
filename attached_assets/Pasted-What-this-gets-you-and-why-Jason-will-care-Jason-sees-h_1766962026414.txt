What this gets you (and why Jason will care)

Jason sees his exact modules preserved in Demo Mode (so he recognizes the original thinking).

He also sees the real product in DTC Mode: verdict → leverage → charts → evidence → compare winner.

You can walk him through the new journey and say:
“Same engine. Better packaging. This is what consumers will pay for.”

If you want one more “chef’s kiss” addition

Add this line to the prompt under Interactions:

Add a “Generate PDF Report” button that exports the Summary + Leverage + Costs pages into a clean printable report (mock export is fine).

That will make Jason instantly imagine distribution + virality.

If you want, paste back Replit’s first output (or screenshots) and I’ll give you a tight revision punch list to make it feel even more premium (spacing, component rhythm, chart labeling, and the “maverick but trustworthy” microcopy).

no you missed all the data in sccreenshot 
Thought for 8m 26s

You’re right — my earlier Replit prompt described the structure, but it didn’t include the actual numbers/text from Jason’s screenshots. Replit won’t infer any of that unless we spell it out.

So here’s what I’m going to do for you:

I’m going to type out the demo flow (original) + the revamped flow (improved).

I’m going to include a “DATA PACK” pulled directly from your screenshots (the real values).

I’m going to give you a Replit prompt that tells it to build the UI with mock data that matches Jason’s demo numbers so you can show him a legit redesign.

The improved world-class flow (same engine, better packaging)

Garage → Report Summary → Leverage Script → Costs (visual) → Evidence → Compare Winner

Garage shows cards with the same computed values (TCO, loss, risk, condition, deal score).

Report Summary shows the verdict + top leverage issues first (not raw tables).

Leverage builder creates the negotiation script + target offer.

Costs tab shows the depreciation curve with markers + TCO breakdown chart.

Evidence tab links every leverage item back to filtered service rows.

Compare is charts + winner banner; the wide acronym tables go under “Advanced”.
