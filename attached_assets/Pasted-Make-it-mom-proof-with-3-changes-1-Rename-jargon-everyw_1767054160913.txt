Make it “mom-proof” with 3 changes
1) Rename jargon everywhere

TCO → 3-Year Cost

Depreciation → Value loss

Repair exposure → Risk of big repairs

Maintenance economy → Routine upkeep cost

Value retention → Holds value

2) Replace “How to read” with “What you’re looking at”

People don’t think in charts. They think “what is this?”

Use:

What you’re looking at

What it means for you

3) Give a 1-line decision takeaway

Every chart explanation ends with:

“Bottom line: pick ___ if you want ___.”

Example rewrites (drop-in)
Depreciation curves

What you’re looking at:
“This shows how much each car is expected to be worth over time.”

What it means for you:
“After 3 years, these two cars are expected to be worth about the same. So this chart doesn’t decide the winner.”

Bottom line:
“Use the cost and repair-risk charts to choose.”

Cost breakdown (stacked bars)

What you’re looking at:
“This shows where your money goes over 3 years: value loss, upkeep, and repairs.”

What it means for you:
“The S7 costs about $2,192 less mainly because it has lower repair risk.”

Bottom line:
“If you want fewer surprise bills, the S7 is safer.”

Scorecard table

What you’re looking at:
“A quick report card. Higher is better.”

What it means for you:
“The A6 scores better on condition, but the S7 is cheaper to own.”

Bottom line:
“Pick A6 if you care most about condition; pick S7 if you care most about total cost.”

UI details that make it readable

Keep explanations to 2–3 short lines max.

Use big numbers and bold deltas (e.g., $2,192 less).

Replace paragraphs with bullets.

Add a “Why?” tooltip for one word at a time, not long tooltips.

Replit copy/paste spec
Make chart explanations “mom-proof”:
- Replace jargon: TCO→3-Year Cost, Depreciation→Value loss, Repair exposure→Risk of big repairs, etc.
- Rename section headers: “How to read this” → “What you’re looking at” and “What it means for you”.
- Cap to 2–3 short sentences + 1 “Bottom line” sentence.
- Always include a numeric delta and a decision cue (“Pick X if…”).
