You’re right to challenge it — so I went back to the actual transcript you uploaded and pulled literally everything Jason said about that page.

Reality check: in this file, Jason’s feedback on the page is one short, specific block (00:00:12 → 00:03:07). There isn’t more “extra detail” in the transcript beyond what’s below.

Jason’s full edit direction (ALL of it, line-by-line)
A) What the page is for

The purpose is to show “high level abstractions from all the other tabs” in the “most concise way possible.” 

riverside_jason_raw-synced-vide…

He says the Executive Summary is “pretty right on.” 

riverside_jason_raw-synced-vide…

B) Missing input that breaks logic (“fairly priced”)

Add a dialog box / user input for cost/price, placed above or inside the Executive Summary. 

riverside_jason_raw-synced-vide…

Reason: it says “fairly priced” but there’s no place to put in the price.

He also calls out “cost of ownership looks really good” as-is.

C) “Risk Evaluation” needs to be re-framed into a cost timeline

“Risk evaluation should be adjusted.” 

riverside_jason_raw-synced-vide…

Because right now it’s basically just repairs, not “risk.” 

riverside_jason_raw-synced-vide…

Change it to a timeline / cost timeline that shows either:

from 0 miles onward, or

from today’s date onward 

riverside_jason_raw-synced-vide…

Use a cumulative cost model as you drive/own over time. 

riverside_jason_raw-synced-vide…

Represent immediate required work as a step change at mile 0 (example: oil change immediately after purchase). 

riverside_jason_raw-synced-vide…

Represent later work as another step at the future mileage (example: another oil change at 10,000 miles). 

riverside_jason_raw-synced-vide…

The visual should be a cumulative line chart increasing over time/miles.

D) What the timeline is supposed to help the user decide

User can see: “If I buy today and own it for X time, I accrue $Y cost and I’m okay with that.” 

riverside_jason_raw-synced-vide…

And: “my probability of accruing a lot more cost with an extra 10,000 miles is too much.” 

riverside_jason_raw-synced-vide…

Example decision logic:

cost is low through ~20k miles

but at 40k it skyrockets → so “I should only own this for 20–30k miles.” 

riverside_jason_raw-synced-vide…

That’s the complete set of directions in the transcript.

Replit-ready task list (copy/paste spec)
1) Add price input control

Component: PriceInput

Label: “Purchase price” (or “Listing price”)

Placement: above Executive Summary (or inside it)

Feeds: “Fairly priced / overpriced / underpriced” logic

2) Keep “Cost of Ownership” section as-is (Jason said it looks good)

Don’t delete it; don’t downgrade it.

3) Replace “Risk Evaluation” section

Rename to: Cost Timeline (or “Cumulative Cost Timeline”)

Chart: cumulative line (step-like jumps allowed)

X-axis: miles from purchase (default) OR time from today (optional toggle)

Must show:

Step at mile 0 if immediate maintenance required

Steps at future mileage markers (10k, etc.)

Ability to interpret “safe to own until ___ miles” vs “skyrockets after ___ miles”

If you think he was more detailed elsewhere, you probably have another clip / transcript (different timestamp or file). Upload it and I’ll merge the full “Jason spec” into one master checklist.
