This Leverage Builder / Smart Script Builder page is basically the right concept and it matches the “talk track” value Jason described — you’ve got:

Approach slider (Friendly → Firm → Hard)

Deal mathematics (asking price, identified leverage, target offer)

Leverage points list

Objection Handlers section

Live script preview + copy
That’s the core of what he wanted from “Build Strategy” and leverage.

So: Yes, it’s good.

But it’s missing 3 “Jason-critical” things and 2 UX fixes.

What’s missing vs transcript
1) Risk tolerance slider (low ↔ high)

Jason explicitly called out risk tolerance in Offer Mode/strategy. 

Dipstick v2 round


Right now I only see the tone/approach slider. Add risk tolerance because it changes what the talk track emphasizes (risk warnings vs price fairness vs maintenance).

Add: Risk tolerance (Low / Medium / High) that affects:

which leverage points are selected by default

how aggressive the target offer is

how “alarmist” the copy is

2) “Build Strategy” button/output

He described “Build Strategy” producing different tones + leverage points. 

Dipstick v2 round


Right now the user is manually selecting leverage points; there’s no explicit “generate a strategy” action.

Add: a button like “Build Strategy” that:

auto-selects leverage points (top 3–5)

chooses a recommended tone

generates the script from those selections

3) Objection Handler must be real and reachable

You have an “Objection Handlers” section — good — but earlier the problem was it wasn’t reachable/consistent across cars due to scroll/modal issues. 

Dipstick v2 round

Make sure:

It is populated (not empty placeholder)

It expands with actual objection/response pairs

It’s consistent for every car

UX problems I see (even from this screenshot)
4) This page is too narrow / too much empty space

The content is centered in a skinny column. It makes it feel like a form, not a “negotiation engine.”

Fix: Use a 2-column layout at desktop:

Left: controls (approach, risk tolerance, math, leverage points, objections)

Right: live script preview (sticky)

5) Script preview needs “modes”

Right now it’s one block of text. Jason’s point is utility.

Add toggles:

Text Message vs Email vs In-person talk track

Optional: Seller vs Dealer tone templates

This reinforces the “arm them with a talk track” framing. 

Dipstick v2 round

One content fix (important)

You already have a “Pro tip” style line — good — but make it explicit that leverage doesn’t guarantee concessions (Jason said: it’s points, not guaranteed results). 

Dipstick v2 round

Replit copy/paste
Leverage Builder is mostly correct (talk track engine + math + leverage points + script preview).
To match transcript, add:

1) Risk tolerance slider (low/med/high) that changes default leverage points + target offer aggressiveness + script tone.
2) Explicit “Build Strategy” button that auto-selects top leverage points and generates the script (different tones).
3) Ensure Objection Handlers are real + expandable + present for every car (not placeholder).

UX:
- Use 2-column desktop layout: left controls, right sticky script preview.
- Add script output modes: Text vs Email vs In-person talk track (and optionally Seller vs Dealer).
- Keep disclaimer framing: leverage is credibility/talk track, not guaranteed concessions.


If you send the Vehicle History tab screenshot next, I’ll confirm whether it matches the “narrative + gaps summary” requirement and whether any “anomaly detection” is incorrectly living in Summary instead of History.
