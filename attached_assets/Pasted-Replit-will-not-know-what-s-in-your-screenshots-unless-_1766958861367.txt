Replit **will not “know” what’s in your screenshots** unless you tell it. So yes — you need to **type the journey + the data model + mock data requirements** into the prompt so it can generate a believable demo you can show Jason.

Below is a **single, fully-loaded Replit prompt** that:

* recreates Jason’s demo modules (even without screenshots),
* fills everything with realistic mock data (Audi examples),
* and shows the **revamped world-class UX** (Garage → Report → Leverage → Costs → Evidence → Compare),
* while preserving an “Original Demo Mode” view so Jason recognizes his flow.

Copy/paste this whole prompt into Replit AI:

```text
Build a world-class direct-to-consumer web app UI called “Dipstick” (used-car leverage + cost-to-own intelligence).
This app is a redesign/revamp of an existing prototype demo. You must implement BOTH:
(1) “Original Demo Mode” navigation (module-first pages) AND
(2) “World-Class DTC Mode” navigation (decision-first journey).
Use realistic mock data throughout so the UI looks real and can be demoed to a stakeholder.

TECH STACK
- Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui
- Recharts for charts
- TanStack Table for tables
- lucide-react icons
- Responsive layout
- No backend required; use mock JSON and local state.

BRAND / VISUAL STYLE
The brand should feel “Maverick + Trustworthy Innovator”.
- Dark premium background (charcoal) with clean white typography
- A single bold accent color (teal/green/blue) for “Dipstick energy”
- Conventional risk colors: green/yellow/red for safety/trust
- Minimal, modern, plenty of whitespace, crisp card layout
- Microcopy should be bold but evidence-based (e.g., “Leverage you can prove”, “Evidence linked below”)

INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE
Create a top-level toggle in the header:
- “DTC Mode” (default)
- “Demo Mode” (original prototype flow)

A) DTC MODE (DECISION-FIRST)
Routes:
1) /  (Garage)
- Vehicle cards showing:
  - Vehicle identity: year make model trim
  - mileage
  - Deal Score (0–100)
  - 3-year TCO (big number)
  - Total loss (secondary)
  - Risk level chip
  - Top leverage bullets (2)
  - Buttons: Open Report, Add to Compare
- “Add Vehicle” CTA in header
- A “Compare Tray” that appears when 2–3 vehicles are selected.

2) /add  (Upload + Parse)
- Drag/drop Carfax PDF UI (fake upload).
- After upload, show a stepper with loading states:
  Step 1 Parse service records
  Step 2 Generate expert analysis
  Step 3 Build routine maintenance schedule
  Step 4 Forecast unscheduled maintenance
  Step 5 Compute gaps and risk evaluation
  Step 6 Market valuation + depreciation curve
  Step 7 Total cost of ownership
- After the stepper completes (fake delay), create a new vehicle in mock state and navigate to /report/[id].

3) /report/[id]  (Premium DTC Report)
Tabs: Summary | Leverage | Costs | Evidence | Advanced
- Summary tab:
  - Hero row metric cards:
    - Dipstick Score
    - Fair price range (private party + retail with ranges)
    - 3-year TCO
    - Risk counts (High/Moderate/Low)
  - Three cards: What’s Good / What’s Concerning / What’s Missing
  - Top 3 leverage items (IssueCards) with “Add to script” button
- Leverage tab:
  - Left: list of leverage IssueCards (gaps + risks, ranked by impact)
  - Each IssueCard includes:
    - title
    - severity chip
    - cost range
    - negotiation angle (1 line)
    - “Questions to ask” bullets
    - evidence tags (clickable pills)
    - button: Add to negotiation script
  - Right: Leverage Drawer (or bottom sheet on mobile) that:
    - shows selected leverage items
    - auto-generates a negotiation script (copy button)
    - shows “Target offer” computed from asking price and leverage total
- Costs tab:
  - Depreciation curve chart with markers:
    - current mileage marker
    - projected mileage at end of ownership horizon (years * miles/year)
  - TCO breakdown chart (stacked bar or waterfall-style):
    - depreciation loss
    - routine maintenance
    - gap maintenance
    - expected repairs (probability-weighted)
    - total cost
  - Assumptions card (collapsible):
    - asking price input
    - ownership years slider
    - miles/year input
    - button “Recalculate”
  - Show expected resale value at horizon.
- Evidence tab:
  - Service history timeline view (grouped by year)
  - Evidence table (TanStack) with:
    - filter chips: All / Maintenance / Repairs / Inspection / Admin
    - search box
    - grouping by year collapsible
    - default hides Admin events (registration/title)
  - Clicking an evidence pill from a leverage card filters the table and highlights matching rows.
- Advanced tab:
  - This should mirror the original demo modules (so stakeholders can recognize the old structure):
    Service History Analysis
    Routine Maintenance
    Unscheduled Forecast
    Gap Analysis
    Risk Evaluation
    Market Valuation
    Total Cost of Ownership
    Comparator Metrics (if needed)

4) /compare  (World-class Compare)
- Compare up to 3 vehicles selected from Garage.
- Top “Winner” banner: “Best 3-year deal: ____” with why bullets.
- Show side-by-side vehicle summary cards.
- Charts:
  - Stacked bar TCO breakdown per vehicle
  - Total loss bar per vehicle
  - Risk counts per vehicle
- Simple comparison table with NO acronyms:
  Columns: Vehicle | Asking Price | Fair Price | 3-yr TCO | Total Loss | Expected Sale Price | Risk Level | Deal Score
- Add “Copy script for winner” CTA.

B) DEMO MODE (ORIGINAL PROTOTYPE FLOW)
Create a route: /demo/[id]
This page mimics the original module-by-module experience with a left sidebar:
- Vehicle Information + Upload/Parse status
- Parsed Service History (raw table)
- Service History Analysis (text blocks)
- Routine Maintenance (table)
- Unscheduled Maintenance Forecast (table)
- Maintenance Gap Analysis (summary + table)
- Risk Evaluation (table with chips)
- Market Valuation (retail/private/trade + depreciation chart + future values)
- Total Cost of Ownership (inputs + calculate)
- Comparator (vehicle selection + purchase price inputs + compare button + results tables)
Important: hide admin actions like “Delete Section” in DTC Mode. In Demo Mode it can appear under a subtle “Debug” accordion.

MOCK DATA REQUIREMENTS (REALISTIC, FILLED OUT)
Create /lib/mockData.ts exporting vehicles[] with at least 3 vehicles:
- 2015 Audi S7 (72,300 miles) – has some gaps and higher repair risk
- 2018 Audi A6 (55,000 miles) – better condition, fewer gaps
- 2017 BMW 540i (68,000 miles) – moderate risk, mixed history
For each vehicle provide complete realistic mock data:

Vehicle fields:
- id, year, make, model, trim, mileage, vin, engine, drivetrain
- askingPrice (editable)
- location (city/state)

Service records (40–60 items each):
- { date, mileage, category (maintenance/repair/inspection/admin), description, location, costEstimate }
Include admin noise (registration/title) so filtering works.

Expert analysis sections:
- overallEvaluation string
- anomalies array
- concerns array
- positiveFindings array
- “services performed more than normal” array

Routine maintenance schedule (20–35 rows):
- { item, dueEveryMiles, dueEveryMonths, estimatedCostRange, riskNote }

Unscheduled forecast (10–25 items):
- { name, windowMin, windowMax, probability, costMin, costMax, description }

Gap analysis (10–20 items):
- { name, status (overdue/dueSoon/notDue), lastPerformedMileage|null, dueAtMileage, estimatedCostRange, severity }

Risk evaluation (15–30 items):
- { name, riskLevel, riskScore, milesUntilFailureBucket, probability, costMin, costMax, alreadyFixed, recommendations[], evidenceTags[] }

Valuation:
- retailValue, privatePartyValue, tradeInValue
- retailRange [min,max], privateRange [min,max], tradeRange [min,max]
- depreciationCurve array: { mileage, retailValue, privateValue }
- projectedFutureValues: { year1, year2, year3, year5 }
- depreciationStats: msrp, totalDepreciation, annualRate, mileageImpact

TCO:
- inputs: years, milesPerYear, askingPrice
- computed: immediateCostBurden, routineMaintenanceCost, expectedUnscheduledRepairCost, depreciationLoss, totalCost, expectedSalePrice, totalLoss
Also provide a breakdown array for charts.

Scores:
- dipstickScore 0–100
- dealScore 0–100
- conditionScore 0–100
- riskLevel Low/Moderate/High
- counts: { high, moderate, low }

Leverage items (8–15 items):
- Derived from high-impact gaps + risks:
  { id, title, severity, costMin, costMax, negotiationAngle, questionsToAsk[], evidenceTags[] }

INTERACTIONS / UX DETAILS
- “Asking price” input should drive:
  - Deal meter (Overpriced/Fair/Underpriced)
  - Target offer recommendation
  - Negotiation script text
- Leverage builder should show a running total: “Justified discount: ~$X–$Y”
- Evidence tags must filter/highlight service history rows.
- Compare page should auto-rank best deal using dealScore or lowest totalLoss; show winner banner.
- Use skeleton loaders and smooth transitions.

DELIVERABLES
Generate all code and files so the app runs without errors.
Ensure mock data renders across all pages with charts and tables populated.
Keep the code modular with reusable components:
VehicleCard, MetricCard, IssueCard, LeverageDrawer, DealMeter, DepreciationChart, TcoChart, EvidenceTable, Timeline.
```

## What this gets you (and why Jason will care)

* Jason sees **his exact modules** preserved in **Demo Mode** (so he recognizes the original thinking).
* He also sees the **real product** in **DTC Mode**: verdict → leverage → charts → evidence → compare winner.
* You can walk him through the new journey and say:
  “Same engine. Better packaging. This is what consumers will pay for.”

---

## If you want one more “chef’s kiss” addition

Add this line to the prompt under Interactions:

> Add a “Generate PDF Report” button that exports the Summary + Leverage + Costs pages into a clean printable report (mock export is fine).

That will make Jason instantly imagine distribution + virality.

If you want, paste back Replit’s first output (or screenshots) and I’ll give you a tight revision punch list to make it *feel* even more premium (spacing, component rhythm, chart labeling, and the “maverick but trustworthy” microcopy).
