But there are 3 upgrades that would make it feel “Jason-level” and also connect it better to the rest of the product:

What’s good (keep)

Valuation Analysis banner (“Fairly Priced” + negotiation delta) — great.

Retail / Private / Trade cards — he referenced exactly this kind of breakdown. 

Dipstick v2 round

Projected Depreciation with a You Are Here marker — good.

What’s missing / what to improve
1) Add “Fair price range” + “3-year low” right here (or in Summary)

He explicitly called out “fair price range” + “three year low” as part of the executive summary/valuation picture. 

Dipstick v2 round

Add:

Fair price range: $X–$Y (for Private Party or whichever you anchor on)

3-year low benchmark: $Z (even if it’s mocked)

2) Make the curve explain the ownership horizon (not just “next 30k miles”)

Your curve subtitle says “next 30k miles,” but the product logic is “ownership period + annual mileage → ownership horizon cost.” That’s a big theme in the transcript (same mental model used for compare). 

Dipstick v2 round

Upgrade:

Add a second marker: “Ownership horizon” (based on your default assumption, e.g., 3 yrs @ 12k/yr)

Add a small readout under the chart:

“Projected value at horizon: $X”

“Projected depreciation loss: $Y”

3) Add a “Why this matters” micro-block (interpretation, not advice)

Jason pushed hard on making outputs interpretation and helping non-graph people understand. 

Dipstick v2 round

 

Dipstick v2 round

Add under the chart:

“How to read this” (you already do this in comparator; do it here too)

“What it means” (one sentence tied to negotiation leverage: “This supports a target offer of …” optional)

One “wiring” improvement that matters

This page should have a strong CTA path to the next step:

“See total ownership cost” (jump to Summary cost breakdown)

“Use this in leverage builder” (preselect “asking vs fair value delta” as a leverage point)

This ties valuation into your negotiation engine (which is the whole product).

Replit copy/paste note
Market Valuation page is mostly correct. Add:
- Fair price range + 3-year low benchmark (even mocked).
- Add an “ownership horizon” marker on depreciation curve (based on default ownership years + annual mileage) and show projected value/loss at horizon.
- Add “How to read this / What it means” microcopy under the chart (interpretation, not advice).
- Add CTAs: “Use this in Leverage Builder” + “See total ownership cost.”
