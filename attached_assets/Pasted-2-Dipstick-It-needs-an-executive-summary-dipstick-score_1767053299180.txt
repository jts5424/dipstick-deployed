2) Dipstick It needs an executive summary + dipstick score (not just price adjustments)

He explicitly said comparator should feel like:

“executive summary” → “dipstick score” and that it’s missing the “train of thinking.” 

Dipstick v2 round

✅ You should have a top section that instantly answers:

who wins

dipstick score(s)

key deltas (TCO, depreciation, repair exposure, gaps)

3) It needs a train-of-thinking narrative

“There’s no train of thinking in the comparator.” 

Dipstick v2 round

He wanted a “high level comparison narrative.” 

Dipstick v2 round

✅ You need 3–5 bullet “why” reasons + a short paragraph tying it together.

4) Dipstick It should be narrative + graphs (graphs are the proof)

He said the comparator should basically be:

“a narrative… and then just the graphs” 

Dipstick v2 round

and “we need to explain the graphs” because people aren’t good at graphs 

Dipstick v2 round

✅ This means each chart needs “How to read” + “What it means” (tooltips or inline).

5) The “signature visuals” he praised

He called out two specific things he loved:

A) The stacked cost breakdown bars (depreciation/maintenance/repairs)

“I love what you did with depreciation, maintenance, repairs… stack those up in a bar chart.” 

Dipstick v2 round

“I love that with the bars… how we do it in engineering.” 

Dipstick v2 round

B) Depreciation + breakdown + narrative together

“depreciation… these breakdowns… and a narrative” 

Dipstick v2 round

✅ These bars can’t be a tiny widget at the bottom. They’re a core proof point.

6) Dipstick It must not become “a second Garage”

This was repeated hard:

“I don’t think we should have cards in the comparator.” 

Dipstick v2 round

Don’t force scrolling past lots of cards — garage already does that 

Dipstick v2 round

Keep any car visuals “small, smaller.” 

Dipstick v2 round

He called out the compare cards having random stats (total loss, deal score, oil change, gap service, full report) and said: don’t put the stats in the car 

Dipstick v2 round

✅ If comparator shows big garage-style cards or loads of “stats in the car,” it violates the spec.

7) Comparator output must be interpretation, not advice

“It can’t be advice… it’ll be an interpretation.” 

Dipstick v2 round

✅ Your narrative copy should say “Based on…” not “We recommend you buy…”

8) Very important boundary: single-car deep data is not in compare

“All the data that they get to see… is not in the compare tool.” 

Dipstick v2 round

✅ Dipstick It should not contain service timelines, repair evidence tables, etc. It should link out to per-car analysis.

“Did we include EVERYTHING?” checklist

Use this like a QA sheet:

Must exist

 Ownership + mileage inputs + Compare button 

Dipstick v2 round

 Market price per car supported (even editable) 

Dipstick v2 round

 Executive summary + Dipstick score 

Dipstick v2 round

 Train-of-thinking narrative 

Dipstick v2 round

 Graph explainers/tooltips 

Dipstick v2 round

 Stacked cost breakdown bars (dep/maint/repairs) as a hero visual 

Dipstick v2 round

 Comparator is fast once upload analysis exists 

Dipstick v2 round

Must NOT happen

 Big garage cards in comparator 

Dipstick v2 round

 Scroll past lots of “cars” to get to charts 

Dipstick v2 round

 Random “stats in the car” (total loss, deal score, etc.) 

Dipstick v2 round

 Deep single-car analysis data dumped into comparator 

Dipstick v2 round

 “We recommend…” advice language 

Dipstick v2 round

If you want my blunt verdict based on your latest Dipstick It screenshots

You’re 80% there structurally (ranked results + charts + table), but the page often loses the executive insight layer (the “why” panel + narrative + explainers) when you move into multi-car ranking. That’s the piece Jason cared about most.

If you keep the multi-car ranking, just make sure the top has:

Executive summary (winner + deltas)

Train-of-thinking (“why it wins”)

Then the charts

That satisfies every requirement above.
