Perfect — here’s production-ready UI copy for that 3-step “Add Vehicle” wizard (tight, confident, not prototype-y). You can paste this straight into Replit as the spec.

Parse result summary (after success)

If gaps found:
“Gaps aren’t always bad — but they reduce certainty and affect risk.”

Form labels (editable fields)

Model

Year

Current mileage

Trim (optional)

Engine (optional)

VIN (recommended)

Error states (important)
Upload error

“Try a CARFAX Vehicle History Report PDF. If you don’t have one, start with a VIN.”

Buttons:

Try another file

Enter VIN instead

Partial parse

Partial results
“We found vehicle details but only 12 service records. You can still continue.”

Buttons:

Save anyway

Try a different PDF

Replit implementation note (short)

Keep the “Save vehicle” button disabled until required fields are present: Make/Model/Year/Mileage.

VIN is recommended but not required; show warning if blank.

After saving, route to Garage with an “Analysis ready / Limited” badge.

If you want, I’ll also write the exact “What PDF works?” modal content + a 3-line “how to download CARFAX PDF” instruction that doesn’t feel spammy.
