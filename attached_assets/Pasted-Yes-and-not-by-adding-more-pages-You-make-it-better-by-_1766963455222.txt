Yes — and not by adding more pages. You make it better by making Dipstick feel like a weaponized decision product: “what to buy + what to offer + how to prove it.” Jason’s demo is analysis-first. The upgrade is action-first + trust-first + delight.

Here are 12 upgrades that will genuinely level it up beyond Jason’s prototype while staying aligned with what he wanted.

1) “Offer Mode” (the killer feature)

Add a mode toggle on each vehicle tile + report:

Offer Mode asks 3 inputs:

Asking price

Your risk tolerance (Low/Med/High)

Time horizon (1/3/5 years)

Then outputs:

Target offer: $X

Walk-away price: $Y

Why: 3 evidence-backed leverage items

This turns Dipstick into “I can negotiate with this.”

2) One-click “Negotiation Script” + “Receipt Request”

Two export buttons:

Copy negotiation script

Copy receipt request list (exact services missing + date ranges)

People will literally use that in messages to sellers. Makes it sticky.

3) Add a “Confidence” score per module (trust layer)

Jason’s data has missing mileage and gaps. Don’t hide it — monetize it.

Each module gets:

Confidence: High/Med/Low

“Why”: mileage completeness, gaps, record count, source quality

This makes you more trustworthy than competitors because you admit uncertainty.

4) “Evidence-first” linking everywhere (your trust superpower)

Take it further than “tags filter a table.”

When you click a leverage item:

It opens a side panel showing:

the exact evidence rows (3–7)

highlighted text

the “missing interval” visualization (e.g., 2019–2022 gap)

Trust is UX, not copy.

5) Make service history readable with a timeline + noise collapse

Right now it’s a table. DTC needs a story.

Default view:

Timeline grouped by year

Admin events collapsed (“12 admin events hidden”)

Highlight “gaps” as shaded bands

This is what makes it feel Apple-clean and not spreadsheet-y.

6) “Risk Urgency Map” (better than a list)

Instead of only risk tables, add one visualization:

A 2x2 plot:

X = “Time to failure” (Soon → Later)

Y = “Cost exposure” (Low → High)

Each dot is a failure item.
Put “You are inside window” as a label.

This makes risk instantly understandable.

7) Survivability curve becomes interactive

Jason mentioned survivability. Make it feel premium:

Toggle Table | Curve

Hover a component: shows

probability at your mileage

typical failure window band

Add “If already fixed, curve drops” visualization

That instantly demonstrates the “subtract if repaired” concept.

8) Depreciation curve with “ownership projection” + “knee explanation”

Not just a line chart.

Add:

Marker A: current mileage

Marker B: projected end mileage

Shaded region: “You’ll likely exit here”

Annotation: “Depreciation knee ~40k”

And show one big statement:
“Expected depreciation loss over 3 yrs: $5,500”

Make it feel like a conclusion, not analytics.

9) “Deal Score” should be explainable, not magic

Jason’s prototype has scores. Make it defensible:

When a user clicks Deal Score:

breakdown bars:

Price fairness (vs private party)

Evidence quality

Gap severity

Risk exposure

Depreciation loss

This avoids “black box vibes” and builds trust.

10) Comparator winner banner should explain why in one glance

Winner banner should include:

Best total loss

Best risk profile

Best evidence confidence

“Offer: $X” for winner

And a CTA:
Generate script for winner

Now compare becomes a decision moment.

11) “Shareable report link” (stakeholder wow)

Even with mock data, add:

“Share report” button

Creates a shareable URL state (fake is fine for now)

Jason will instantly imagine virality + sales.

12) Add “Maverick” without losing trust

Maverick doesn’t mean edgy UI. It means confident framing.

Examples:

“Dealer math, decoded.”

“Leverage: $1,200–$2,400 you can justify.”

“Receipts or price drop.”

But always paired with:

“Evidence linked below.”

That’s the combo: bold + provable.

If you want the single highest impact “better” move:

Make the Comparator tile show three things:

Target offer

$ you’ll lose

Top leverage

And one button: Copy script

That’s a DTC product.
