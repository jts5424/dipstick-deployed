Got you. Here’s a **single copy/paste Replit prompt** that will generate the full “world-class Dipstick” UI + journey from scratch (prototype-first, mock data, charts, then wire to backend later).

Copy everything below into Replit AI.

```text
You are building a world-class direct-to-consumer web app UI called “Dipstick” (Used Car Negotiation Leverage Platform). 
Goal: take a user from “upload Carfax” → “get verdict + negotiation leverage + costs” → “compare 2–3 vehicles” with clean charts and a premium DTC experience.

TECH REQUIREMENTS
- Use Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript.
- Use Tailwind CSS.
- Use shadcn/ui components.
- Use Recharts for charts.
- Use TanStack Table for tables.
- Use lucide-react icons.
- Must be responsive (desktop first, but mobile usable).
- Build with mock data first (hardcoded JSON), but structure code so data can be replaced by API calls later.

INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE / PAGES
Create these routes:

1) / (Garage / Home)
- Shows “Your Garage” with Vehicle Cards (2–6 cards).
- Each Vehicle Card shows:
  - Year Make Model Trim
  - Current mileage
  - Deal Score (0–100) badge
  - 3-Year TCO (big number)
  - Total Loss (secondary)
  - Risk Level chip (Low/Moderate/High)
  - Top 2 leverage bullets (ex: “Gap: Missing brake fluid service”, “Risk: Transmission solenoids”)
  - Buttons: “Open Report” and “Compare”
- Top bar includes: “Add vehicle” button.

2) /add (Upload + Parse)
- Drag/drop “Carfax PDF” upload UI (no real parsing yet).
- On upload, show a parsing stepper UI:
  Step 1: Parse service records
  Step 2: Detect routine schedule
  Step 3: Identify gaps
  Step 4: Forecast unscheduled risk
  Step 5: Market valuation
  Step 6: TCO calculation
- When “parsing” completes (fake timeout), route user to /report/[id].

3) /report/[id] (Single Vehicle Report)
This is the premium report experience with tabs:
- Summary
- Leverage
- Costs
- Evidence

Summary tab:
- Hero row (4 metric cards):
  - Dipstick Score
  - 3-Year TCO
  - Fair Price Range (retail/private party)
  - Risk Count (High/Moderate/Low)
- “What’s good / What’s concerning / What’s missing” as 3 cards with bullets.
- “Top 3 leverage items” (IssueCard list) with button “Add to negotiation script”.

Leverage tab:
- Leverage Builder panel:
  - List of IssueCards the user has selected (start with mock selected items).
  - Generates a “Negotiation Script” text block (copy button).
  - Each IssueCard should have:
    - Title
    - Severity chip
    - Cost exposure range
    - Evidence tags (clickable)
    - Button “Add to script”
- Add a right-side drawer (or bottom sheet on mobile) that shows the script and selected leverage items.

Costs tab:
- Depreciation chart with two markers:
  - Current mileage
  - Projected mileage at ownership horizon
- TCO Breakdown waterfall-like stacked bar:
  - Depreciation loss
  - Routine maintenance
  - Gap maintenance
  - Expected repairs (probability weighted)
  - Total
- Assumptions card (collapsible):
  - Asking price input
  - Ownership years
  - Miles per year
  - Button “Recalculate”
- Also show “Expected resale value in X years”.

Evidence tab:
- Service history timeline + table:
  - Default filters hide “administrative” events (registration/title).
  - Filter chips: All / Maintenance / Inspection / Repairs / Admin
  - Search box.
  - Group by year collapsible sections.
  - Click an evidence tag from a leverage item filters the table.

4) /compare (Comparator)
- User can select up to 3 vehicles from garage.
- Each selected vehicle is shown as a compact card with asking price input.
- Show “Winner” banner (Best 3-year deal).
- Comparison charts:
  - Stacked bar TCO breakdown per vehicle.
  - Total Loss per vehicle (bar).
  - Risk summary chips.
- Comparison table (simple, no acronyms):
  Columns: Vehicle, Asking Price, 3-Year TCO, Total Loss, Expected Sale Price, Risk Level, Deal Score.
- Hide any advanced acronyms (ICB/EURC/C12). If needed, put them under an “Advanced metrics” accordion with tooltips.

DESIGN / UX RULES
- Never show “Delete Section” or admin controls in the consumer UI.
- Outcome-first: summary + verdict first, details later.
- No wide horizontal scrolling tables for primary views.
- Use consistent spacing, typographic hierarchy, and card layout.
- Use chips/badges for severity and risk.
- Add subtle loading states and skeletons.

DATA MODEL (mock JSON)
Create a mock data file in /lib/mockData.ts that exports:
- vehicles: array of vehicle objects
Each vehicle object should include:
  id, year, make, model, trim, mileage,
  valuation: { retail, privateParty, tradeIn, retailRange, privateRange },
  depreciationCurve: array of { mileage, retailValue, privateValue },
  tco: { years, milesPerYear, askingPrice, depreciationLoss, routineMaintenance, gapMaintenance, expectedRepairs, totalCost, expectedSalePrice },
  scores: { dipstickScore, dealScore, conditionScore, riskLevel },
  leverageItems: array of { id, title, severity, costMin, costMax, evidenceTags[], negotiationAngle, questionsToAsk[] },
  risks: array of { name, riskLevel, probability, windowMin, windowMax, costMin, costMax, milesUntilFailureBucket },
  gaps: array of { name, status: overdue|dueSoon|notDue, dueAtMileage, costMin, costMax },
  serviceRecords: array of { date, mileage, type, description, location, category: admin|maintenance|inspection|repair }

IMPLEMENTATION TASKS
1) Scaffold Next.js app with Tailwind + shadcn/ui installed and configured.
2) Create layout with top nav “Dipstick” and left “Garage” link.
3) Build shared components:
- VehicleCard
- MetricCard
- IssueCard
- LeverageDrawer
- DepreciationChart (Recharts)
- TcoBreakdownChart (Recharts)
- EvidenceTable (TanStack Table)
4) Build all pages with mock data working end-to-end.
5) Add routing: clicking a vehicle card opens /report/[id]. Compare navigates to /compare with selected vehicles stored in state (use URL query or simple global store).
6) Keep code clean, modular, and easy to replace mock data with API calls later.

OUTPUT
Generate all required files and code. Ensure the app runs without errors.
```

### After you run that prompt in Replit

Your *first win* is: a fully navigable UI with mock data + charts. Then you swap mockData with real parsing/compute.

If Replit asks follow-ups (framework choices, etc.), answer:

* **Next.js 14 App Router**
* **TypeScript**
* **Tailwind + shadcn/ui**
* **Recharts**
* **TanStack Table**

If you want, paste the repo Replit generates (or screenshots of the first build) and I’ll give you the exact punch list to tighten it into “Apple clean” (spacing, typography, chart labeling, leverage drawer UX).
