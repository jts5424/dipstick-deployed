Because you shifted Dipstick It into multi-car “Ranked Results + charts” mode, and when you did that you effectively dropped the executive summary + train-of-thinking layer that Jason kept emphasizing.

Multi-car didn’t require losing that. It just requires restructuring it so it doesn’t become a wall of text.

What Jason wanted that’s missing here

He wanted the compare experience to have:

Executive summary (what wins + key deltas)

Train-of-thinking / insights explaining why

Then graphs as proof (with “how to read” help)

Right now you have:

ranking (good)

charts (good)

scorecard table (fine)
But you’re missing the insight layer that makes it feel intelligent instead of just “a dashboard.”

How to bring the “advanced information” back without clutter
1) Add a “Why this wins” panel directly under Ranked Results

For the #1 vehicle (or selected vehicle), show 3–5 drivers:

Why the 2015 S7 ranks #1

Lower 3-yr TCO by $2,192

Better value retention at 7 yrs (+$X resale at horizon)

Lower repair exposure (–$Y)

Fewer critical service gaps (0 vs 2)

Recall status verified (or “needs verification”)

This is the missing “smart analysis.”

2) Add “Drivers” as an expandable drawer for each vehicle row

Each ranked row gets:

Top 3 drivers

“View details” expands to show:

service gaps count + years

immediate liability

open recalls

top 3 risks (from the risk model)

Still compact, but now it feels “advanced.”

3) Don’t hide the “explain the charts” layer

Under each chart, add:

How to read this

What it means (for the top car)

You had that in the earlier single-pair version; it’s absent here.

4) Bring back the “Advanced” toggle

Top right: Advanced

Off = ranking + charts

On = adds:

“Why this wins” panel

per-vehicle driver breakdown

chart explainers
This keeps the default clean.

Replit copy/paste spec
Dipstick It lost the executive summary + insight layer when switching to multi-car ranking mode.

Add back:
1) “Why this wins” panel under Ranked Results (3–5 drivers for #1 or selected vehicle).
2) Expandable “Drivers” drawer on each ranked row (service gaps, immediate liability, recalls, top risks).
3) Chart explainers under each chart: “How to read” + “What it means.”
4) Optional “Advanced” toggle to show/hide these insight sections (keep default clean).


If you want the page to feel premium: make clicking a ranked row set it as the “focus car” (highlights its curve/bars and updates the “Why this wins” panel). That turns it into an interactive analysis, not static charts.
