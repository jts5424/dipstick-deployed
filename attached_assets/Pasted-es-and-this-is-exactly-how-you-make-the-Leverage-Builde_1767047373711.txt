es — and this is exactly how you make the Leverage Builder feel “bulletproof”: build an Objection Library that’s dynamically generated from your app’s own findings (valuation, gaps, recalls, risks) + seller type + tone.

Below is a full spec you can drop into Replit: objection list, how to generate the best response, and how to wire it to your existing Selected Points + Deal Math + tabs.

1) The Objection Library (what to include)

You want 3 layers:

Layer A — Core objections (universal)

These happen in almost every negotiation:

“We priced to market.”

“We already discounted it.”

“Someone else is coming / I have other offers.”

“Sold as-is.”

“That’s normal wear and tear.”

“Those issues are minor / you’re nitpicking.”

“No one expects perfect service records.”

“You won’t find better at this price.”

“That’s just a known issue, doesn’t mean it’ll happen.”

“We can’t negotiate on price.” (dealer)

“Fees are non-negotiable.” (dealer)

“That’s the best we can do.”

“Take it or leave it.”

“Bring cash today and maybe.”

“Prove it.” / “Show me evidence.”

“If you want warranty, buy new.”

“We already did the service.” (no receipts)

“Recall isn’t a big deal.”

“The CARFAX is clean.”

**“Mileage is fine.” (even if inconsistent reporting)

Layer B — Evidence-driven objections (based on your selected points)

These are triggered when the buyer references:

Service gaps

Immediate maintenance

Projected repairs

Recall

Valuation delta

Mileage inconsistency

Examples:

“Those gaps don’t mean maintenance wasn’t done.”

“That risk chart is just hypothetical.”

“Recall has probably been handled.”

“Your ‘fair price’ is just an estimate.”

Layer C — Seller-type objections (dealer vs private)

Dealer-specific

“We don’t negotiate over text.”

“Come in and we’ll talk.”

“We only discuss out-the-door in person.”

“We can’t remove doc fee.”

Private party

“I’m not a dealer; I’m not discounting for every little thing.”

“I’ve owned it for years; it’s fine.”

“I don’t have records but I did the work.”

2) Make it “bulletproof” with a Response Engine (not static text)

Each objection response should output 4 things:

A) One-sentence “label” (de-escalation)

“It sounds like you’ve got interest at this price.”

B) One evidence line pulled from your app

“I’m seeing a service gap from 2019–2022 and a high-probability risk window around 70–90k.”

C) A calibrated question (forces them to solve with you)

“How do you want to account for that in the price or in receipts/service before purchase?”

D) Two-option close (price vs fix)

“Would you rather adjust to $24,300 or handle the belt/coolant before pickup?”

That structure makes you hard to “hand-wave.”

3) Wire it to what’s already in your app

You already have:

Seller type (dealer/private)

Tone

Risk tolerance

Selected points

Deal math (asking, identified leverage, target offer)

Phase tabs (Verify, Reality, Offer, Objections, Close)

So the logic is:

Objection reply = f(objection, seller_type, tone, risk_tolerance, selected_points, deal_math, phase)

Examples:

If objection = “priced to market” AND you have a valuation delta:

response emphasizes fair price range / retail vs private / OTD

If objection = “sold as-is” AND you have immediate maintenance due:

response emphasizes immediate liability + either/or close

If objection = “records don’t matter” AND you have service gap:

response asks for receipts or price adjustment, not debate

4) Add an “Objection Mode” UI that makes it feel like a weapon
UI layout

Search bar: “Type what they said…”

Chips: Dealer / Private, Tone, Risk tolerance

Accordion list by category:

Price & Market

Condition & Maintenance

Risk & “Hypothetical”

Records & Proof

Dealer fees & process

Time pressure & other buyers

Each objection row shows:

Objection phrase (as seller says it)

“Recommended response” (1–3 lines)

Buttons:

Copy Text

Copy Email

Add to Script (in the Objections phase)

5) “Bulletproof” = proactive scripts BEFORE they object

Add a toggle: “Pre-butt objections” (accusation audit style).
Example:

“You might feel like I’m nitpicking— I’m not. I’m just pricing the immediate liabilities in.”

That prevents a lot of pushback.

6) Replit-ready master prompt for Objection Replies (drop-in)
You are Dipstick’s Objection Response Engine.

Inputs:
- seller_type: dealer|private
- tone: friendly|firm|hard
- risk_tolerance: low|medium|high
- objection_text: the seller’s exact phrase
- asking_price, target_offer, identified_leverage_total
- selected_points: [{title, category, evidence_trigger, cost_range_min, cost_range_max, confidence}]
- key_flags: {open_recall, service_gaps, high_risk_window, mileage_inconsistency}
- phase: verify|reality_check|offer|objections|close

Output:
- reply_text (<= 550 chars)
- reply_email (<= 1200 chars)
- reply_talk_track (<= 8 bullets)
- structure must be:
  1) label (de-escalate)
  2) one objective evidence line from selected_points/key_flags
  3) calibrated question (“How/What…”)
  4) either/or close (price vs fix vs receipts)
- Avoid threats, avoid insults, avoid legal claims.
- Always end with one sentence: “I’m using objective maintenance/valuation signals to frame a fair deal.”

7) Short list: the “Top 12” objections you should ship first

If you want MVP:

Priced to market

Already discounted

Sold as-is

Those are minor

Service records don’t matter

Risk is hypothetical

Someone else is coming

Best we can do

Fees non-negotiable (dealer)

Come in and talk (dealer)

Recall isn’t a big deal

Prove it / show evidence

Copy/paste instruction for Replit
Build an Objection Library + Response Engine.

- Store 30–50 common objections (dealer + private).
- Allow search by “what they said.”
- Generate dynamic responses using app data (selected leverage points + valuation delta + recall + gaps) and adapt by tone + seller_type + risk_tolerance.
- Response format: label → evidence → calibrated question → either/or close.
- Include “Pre-butt objections” option.
- Allow “Add to Script” in the Objections phase and copy as Text/Email/Talk Track.


If you want, tell me whether your target users are mostly buying from dealers or private party, and I’ll prioritize the objection library and write the exact responses for your default dataset (S7/A6 example) so you can hardcode MVP behavior without an LLM.
