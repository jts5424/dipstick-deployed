This Vehicle History page is very close to what Jason asked for. In the transcript, his asks for this page were specific and pretty narrow:

What Jason wanted (and you already have)

A general “Vehicle History” tab (separate from service/repairs tabs). 

Dipstick v2 round

A narrative at the top (“History Narrative”) — not just raw records. 

Dipstick v2 round

A clear separation of concerns so this isn’t muddled with other tabs. 

Dipstick v2 round

You’ve implemented those.

What’s still missing vs transcript (and what to change)
1) Add a “Gaps summary” section (explicit ask)

Jason said “gaps should be treated as a summary of the history” — not just a callout in the timeline. 

Dipstick v2 round

Add directly under History Narrative:

Known gaps: “2019–2022 missing service history”

Confidence impact: “reduces confidence in maintenance cadence”

Likely interpretation: “work may have been done but undocumented” vs “maintenance likely deferred” (keep it as interpretation)

2) Add non-service ownership/context milestones

In the transcript, his examples for Vehicle History were about broader timeline: manufacturer delivery, dealer purchase, operated in X state for Y years, etc. 

Dipstick v2 round

Right now your timeline appears to be mostly service events.
Add a small “Ownership & Context” block above the service timeline:

“Registered in: Ohio”

“Observed mileage consistency: mostly consistent / inconsistent”

“Usage pattern: steady mileage / long gaps / clustered servicing”
(You can mock this now.)

3) Move “anomaly detection / over-serviced items” here (if it’s still elsewhere)

He explicitly said “clean green anomaly detection / over-serviced items” belongs in Vehicle History, not Summary. 

Dipstick v2 round

So in this tab add a subsection:

Anomalies & Signals

“Repeated ‘visual inspection only’ notes”

“Service frequency unusually high/low”

“Mileage reporting missing in X entries”

4) Add “jump links” to the leverage builder

This is not stated verbatim, but it follows the “make narrative actionable” intent:

When you show a gap/anomaly, add a button: “Use as leverage” (preselects the leverage point in Leverage Builder).

This keeps the product tight end-to-end.

Replit copy/paste spec
Vehicle History page is close. Transcript-required additions:

- Add a dedicated “Gaps Summary” section under History Narrative (gaps treated as a summary, not just timeline callout).
- Add non-service milestones/context block (ownership/operated-in/usage pattern) separate from service events.
- Add “Anomalies & Signals” subsection here (over-serviced items / mileage inconsistencies / repeated inspection-only notes). This content should NOT live in Summary.
- Add “Use as leverage” action on gaps/anomalies to preselect leverage points in Leverage Builder.


If you want, paste the current data fields you have for “vehicle history” (location, owners, title events, etc.). I’ll tell you the exact top-of-tab layout so it reads like a real CARFAX-level storyline, not just another service feed.
