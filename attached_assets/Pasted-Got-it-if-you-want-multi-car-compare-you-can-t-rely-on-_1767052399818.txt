Got it — if you want multi-car compare, you can’t rely on “select/deselect tiles” at the top. That will collapse under 10 cars.

You need a Comparison Set model.

The right UX model for multiple cars
Core idea: “Compare Set” (like a playlist)

Users build a set of cars to compare (2–10+).

Dipstick It always shows:

Ranked results (winner + ordering)

Charts that can handle N cars without turning into spaghetti

Where the set lives

Best place: Garage

Each car card has a checkbox: Add to Compare

Sticky bar appears: Compare Set (3) → “Compare” button

Clicking Compare opens Dipstick It with that set preloaded

This scales naturally because Garage is where selection belongs.

Dipstick It layout for multi-car (what to build)
A) Top: Compare Set controls

Selected cars as pills (scrollable):

2015 S7 ✕ 2018 A6 ✕ 2017 Q5 ✕ …

+ Add car (opens a search dropdown from Garage list)

Clear all

Inputs: Ownership years + Annual mileage

Optional: Market price per car (edit inline on each pill)

B) Results: “Leaderboard” (must exist)

Instead of one “winner card,” show a ranked list:

Ranked Results

2015 S7 — Dipstick 81 — Low Risk — 3-yr TCO $8,675

2018 A6 — Dipstick 74 — Med Risk — 3-yr TCO $9,980

…

This is the “executive summary” for multi-car. It replaces the current dashboard feel.

C) Charts: avoid spaghetti

With 6–10 cars, multi-line charts get unreadable. So:

Chart 1: Depreciation curves (N lines, but with focus)

Default: show top 4 by score

Others are muted until clicked

Clicking a car in the leaderboard highlights its curve (bold) and dims others

Chart 2: TCO comparison (bars scale better than lines)

Horizontal bars sorted by lowest cost

Toggle: “Total” vs “By year (1/2/3)”

Chart 3: Cost breakdown (stacked bars per car)

Depreciation / Maintenance / Repairs stacked bars for each car

This scales well to 10 cars.

D) Performance scorecard (table, not little bars)

For multiple cars, your current scorecard becomes a table:

Car	Value Retention	Reliability	Maint Economy	Condition	Deal Rating

Sort by any column.

Handling “10 cars” without chaos
Hard UX limits (do these)

Allow up to 10 cars in the set

But only show top 4 curves at once in the depreciation chart

Everything else is accessible via highlight/filter, not always visible

Quick filters

“Show top 3”

“Show lowest risk only”

“Hide cars missing VIN / missing history report” (optional quality control)

How it “adds up” (calculation model)

When you click Compare, compute per car:

Dipstick score

3-yr TCO (based on ownership years + mileage input)

Repair exposure (risk tolerance can affect how you weight this)

Depreciation loss at horizon
Then sort for leaderboard + render charts.

Copy/paste spec for Replit
Implement multi-car comparison as a “Compare Set”.

Garage:
- Add checkbox “Add to Compare” on car cards
- Sticky bar: “Compare Set (N)” + Compare button
- Compare opens Dipstick It with selected set

Dipstick It:
- Top: pills for selected cars (remove with X), “+ Add car” dropdown, Clear, inputs (years + mileage), Compare CTA
- Executive Summary becomes a leaderboard (ranked cars with Dipstick score + risk + 3-yr TCO)
- Charts:
  1) Depreciation curves: show top 4 by default; clicking a car highlights its curve; others muted
  2) TCO: horizontal bars sorted
  3) Cost breakdown: stacked bars per car (dep/maint/repairs)
- Performance scorecard becomes a sortable table across cars
- Avoid spaghetti: never show 10 bold lines at once; use highlight/mute behavior


If you want this to feel insanely good: add “Pin winner” so the top car stays highlighted while you toggle others on/off.
